      <p>As with everyone, let alone bloggers, life can grab you by the collar and you just gotta run with it!
With my hectic life aside, I feel it is appropriate to set some expectations for what kind of content I <em>intend</em> to write here, along with a brief introduction.
Even if it is mostly to motivate myself to check off some boxes in the future, heheh.</p>
<p>I am Errant and I think about <em>many</em> things!
In my daily life, I am a computer scientist.
I research topics, analyze problems, design mathematical models &amp; develop algorithmic solutions!
Here, I will do the same for my hobbies, sharing more freeform thoughts that occur over time as I learn, and revising some pages as a wiki for the refined concepts.</p>

<h2 id="community-creative-events">Community Creative Events</h2>
<p>So far, my blog's content has mostly been for community blogging events, especially the <a href="https://errantthinking.com/christmas-in-july-2025/">OSR Secret Santicorn</a>.
My <a href="https://errantthinking.com/the-elves-revolt/">first post</a> was a TTRPG adventure I made in three days for last year's Santicorn, and since then I've compiled a history of that event, wrote some more for past blog prompts, participated in Prismaticwastelands' <a href="https://errantthinking.com/hexmas-2025/">Merry Hexmas 2025</a>, and hosted my own <a href="https://errantthinking.com/adventure-town/">Secret Sanitcorn in 2025</a>.
I also have more unpublished responses to undelivered present's of Christmas' past worth sharing after a polish (I'm looking at you, 1d12 of Cyborg Angels).</p>
<p>This year, I intend to continue to regularly participate in community blog events and even host my own.
I'll be the host of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://ofdiceanddragons.com/rpg-blog-carnival/">RPG Blog Carnival</a> in March with the theme "Tiny Epics: Small Souls in a Big World!".
Future Prismaticwasteland blogwagons will be calling my name I am sure,
and the IndieWeb Blog Carnival looks promising as well.
The design of community creative events is very intriguing, so look forward to a design post from my where I consider existing event types and consider new ones!</p>
<p>I find community blog events to be good fun and a great way to connect with the existing blogging community around a hobby.
While I will continue these and other community blog events, I do not intend it to be my main form of content.</p>
<h2 id="asking-questions-sharing-thoughts">Asking Questions, Sharing Thoughts</h2>
<p>In the beginning and to this day, I <em>intend</em> Errant Thinking to be primarily about <strong>educational</strong> content for my various muses:</p>
<ul>
<li>science,</li>
<li>technology,</li>
<li>philosophy,</li>
<li>psychology,</li>
<li>writing.</li>
<li>research, design, &amp; development all throughout!</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm inspired by various content creators in education including but certainly not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/@OverlySarcasticProductions">Overly Sarcastic Productions</a> : Writing &amp; History</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.3blue1brown.com/">3 Blue 1 Brown</a> : Mathematics</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.veritasium.com/">Veritasium</a> : Science &amp; Engineering</li>
<li><a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.minutephysics.com/">Minute Physics</a> : Physics</li>
</ul>
<p>The engineering projects on <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://hackaday.com/">Hackaday</a> also look incredibly fun and  <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://distill.pub/">distill.pub</a> (now on indefinite hiatus) featured superb interactive tutorials, which fortunately the trend continues to pop up over the internet.
Exploring fun projects, making educational tutorials and sharing my design notes are my primary intended content.</p>
<h3 id="why-tabletop-roleplaying-games-ttrpgs">Why Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs)?</h3>
<p>A natural question to ask!
TTRPGs have been a love of mine since I was young and I recently delved deeper into them as I have found they let me explore a plethora of my hobbies all together!</p>
<ul>
<li>I practice my 2D art, whether traditional sketches or digital painting.</li>
<li>I hone my narrative ability in storytelling, improvisation, and story craft.
<ul>
<li>Designing good adventures requires the above in combination with a consideration of the players and their play experience as we work together to tell a story. A cocktail I seem to love!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>I design &amp; develop TTRPGs faster than video game development, which is another of my hobbies, but one that has a steeper learning curve for the tools.
<ul>
<li>I've slowly been learning <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://godotengine.org/">Godot</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Mathematical modeling of probabilities and game theory certainly applies along with designing a good user experience.</li>
<li>I also get to explore civilization structure, operations, and politics.</li>
</ul>
<p>Truly a great creative outlet.
Perhaps best of all, I get to have fun with my friends and the lovely community of TTRPG designers!</p>

<h2 id="current-priorities">Current Priorities</h2>
<p>Here's a smattering of my current hobby priorities that I'll post here.
These are of course subject to change on a whim!
Included are various projects I've started in various phases of research &amp; design.
My biggest being Small Souls and the underlying game system, which you'll hear more about I'm sure!
:]</p>
<h3 id="1-ttrpgs">1. TTRPGs</h3>
<ul>
<li>My own games and their related topics:
<ul>
<li><strong>Small Souls</strong>: Everything it touches upon will get a post:
<ul>
<li>Collection of Media, TTRPGs, and blogs on little people &amp; creatures</li>
<li>playable character design
<ul>
<li>The probability of dice pools (A big blog post here!)</li>
<li>The experience gameplay procedures</li>
<li>character state and user experience (UX)</li>
<li>experiential character growth</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>creature design</li>
<li>world building, especially biomes</li>
<li>faction design &amp; dynamics in play</li>
<li>adventure design</li>
<li>social drama, political intrigue, character relationships</li>
<li>Box Set design: I am excited about this one! Brings it all together.</li>
<li>promotion, marketing, getting it to those who want it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Gnomies</strong>: A whimsical game about things spiralling out of control, primarily for one shots and ridiculous hijinks.</li>
<li><strong>Affinity Divined</strong> : A Tarot card based retroactive story telling game inspired by For the Queen and Decuma for world building and backstories.</li>
<li>Loose Ideas: Mecha Game, Cyberpunk game (Cyber Souls).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>My own settings / adventures:
<ul>
<li><strong>The Hunt of Jolnir</strong> : An epic Christmas folklore adventure as a refinement of my <a href="https://errantthinking.com/the-elves-revolt/">original adventure</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Ophelos</strong>: A sword &amp; sorcery fantasy island setting inspired by Hellenistic and maybe Mediterranean folklore.
<ul>
<li>"<em>The Verdant Voyager</em>" : a seafaring adventure on the way to Ophelos.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>The Rawring Twenties</strong>: A cyberpunk setting inspired by 1920s class meets 2020s brain rot (and older 2000s memes lol)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A TTRPG blogosphere quickstart guide, esp. for a TTRPG game designer. This will essentially be an annotated sign post to map out useful concepts across the web.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-meta">2. Meta</h3>
<p>The things I do with this website or in general as a level above the main things I'm creating.</p>
<ul>
<li>update website theme/style to something custom and clean</li>
<li>add useful functionality to website,
<ul>
<li>meta tag feed under About, so it serves as a "now" page too.</li>
<li>Comments on site somehow, as independent yet cross platform as possible. I have a <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ErrantThinking/">subreddit</a> for this purpose for now, if you're interested to discuss on the topics I'm writing about.</li>
<li>Newsletter eventually.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>properly setup tag system for Atom/RSS
<ul>
<li>Feeds already exist but may change unless I can keep em as is.</li>
<li>I have programmer and design thoughts on tags and how they are terrific. Worth a blog post, perhaps more about "blogging" or "technology" than meta.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="3-writing-and-philosophy">3. Writing and Philosophy</h3>
<p>Science and technology could get jostled up in priority on a whim.</p>
<ul>
<li>On writing, I have thoughts on the information contained within --or, more interestingly,  <em>not</em> contained within--  a <strong>poem</strong>, or the various meanings of <strong>idioms</strong>.</li>
<li>I have long had thoughts about <a href="https://errantthinking.com/self-reflection/">self-reflection</a>, especially around November--New Years.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="4-science-technology">4. Science &amp; Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>No idea atm. I know I can talk about probability &amp; statistics and modeling problems.  That will probably occur throughout my other interests.</li>
<li>I was considering some Hydroponics experiments late last summer, but I messed up growing the seedlings. RIP.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-other">5. Other:</h3>
<p>I also want to include some recipes, which I've already <a href="https://errantthinking.com/roadside-inns/#1-moss-dragon-inn">snuck a couple in a prior post</a>.</p>
<h2 id="join-in-on-the-fun">Join in on the Fun!</h2>
<p>This is my current intent, and hopefully the act of listing it out will  give me some form of accountability to eventually deliver that which I either am or wish to be creating.</p>
<p>Thanks for reading. If you want to follow along or perhaps even join me on my creative endeavors, feel free to reach out on your choice of social media! I'm <code>ErrantThinking</code> everywhere. :]</p>
