      <p>Settlements often serve as a safe haven or a base of operations in traditional roleplaying games, with cities being the most common place for an adventure to occur in a settlement.
<em>What about smaller settlements?</em>
As part of the <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/rpg-cauldron-secret-santicorn-2025/3365">RPG Cauldron Secret Santicorn</a> I'm hosting in 2025, which is separate from the typical Rainbow OSR Secret Santicorn, I received a request by <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://sultansmusings.bearblog.dev/">Sully Tames</a> to explore making the settlement itself the adventure site.</p>
<h2 id="the-request">The Request</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>The town/settlement as an adventure site in itself. What if you never had to leave the tavern to go on an adventure?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Alright! This is a good one that lets me use my research skills to understand what already exists out there and then provide some analysis of patterns and ways to make the adventure stay in a confined location.
I use "settlement" to include a single more permanent building than a campsite in the smallest scale and a city in the largest scale.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The people make the place.
</p>
<p>I open with my thoughts to directly answer the question of how this could be achieved, and then I list some of the different TTRPGs, settings, and adventures I discovered in my research of the <a href="https://errantthinking.com/adventure-town/#history-relevant-works">history &amp; relevant works</a>.</p>
<h2 id="properties-of-settlement-adventures">Properties of Settlement Adventures</h2>
<p>As we focus on adventures, there are various properties of what makes a good adventure worth considering.
However, the in-depth analysis of what makes a good adventure will have to be saved for a future post, one I have been slowly gathering notes for over the past half a year.
Here, we shall focus on what makes an adventure set in a settlement <em>unique</em>.</p>
<p>A settlement is</p>
<ul>
<li>made by <strong>people</strong></li>
<li>to serve <strong>a purpose</strong></li>
<li>that includes <strong>longterm living arrangements</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>An adventure set in a settlement entails the intertwining of <strong>society</strong> with that adventure.
All three parts above serve to unveil what kind of society exists behind this settlement.
When the settlement is small, say a single building isolated from the rest of its civilization, then it serves as a microcosm of that society.</p>
<p>I'd argue that any settlement setting in an adventure will always be a microcosm of the society simply given it won't be a simulation of a full city and community.
However, this is certainly emphasized in small scale for things such as towns or forts.</p>
<p>The customs of the people who made the place, who live there currently
The people color the world and the society</p>
<h3 id="the-people">The People</h3>
<p>The people characterize the setting in how they treat it, live in it, and change it.
The people of a settlement include</p>
<ul>
<li>those <strong>who made</strong> the settlement,</li>
<li>those <strong>who lived</strong> in the settlement, and</li>
<li>those <strong>who currently live</strong> in the settlement.</li>
</ul>
<p>The aspect of time is featured throughout this list with focus on the past and present.
At times it is worth considering whether those in the past considered those who would live here in the future.
The things they did or didn't do for those in the future characterizes themselves and helps set the world for those to come.</p>
<h3 id="the-purpose">The Purpose</h3>
<p>The purpose of the settlement will vary case by case, but typically always includes the purpose of <em>someone</em> or <em>something</em> to live at that location.
It gets more interesting when we consider the society that this settlement is a satellite of.
Is this a settlement of a people who need a new home? Of those who were banished to the outer reaches of their core civilization? Or is it an outpost that serves to protect the rest of society from what could come from beyond?
The purpose of the place can paint the originating society in broad strokes!</p>

<p>This emphasizes what the people need to live out here, along with their culture and way of life.
What is prioritized in the living quarters can inform what it was like for those to live here, and at times more subtly inform how it was intended to be lived in.</p>
<p>A cylindrical tower only intended by those <em>who made it</em> as a tactically placed watchtower may communicate this through its simple structure and minimal rooms.
Those who once lived here may have embraced that intended purpose. Tally marks are scored in the walls to count down the days until they could return to a more fulfilling, or at least a more entertaining, way of life.
Perhaps the ones who live here now challenge its intended design through their decorations that express their individuality and furniture to make the common room into a <em>living room</em> for playing games and merry making.</p>
<h3 id="emphasis-on-society">Emphasis on Society</h3>
<p>The emphasis on a current living society is what puts a settlement in stark contrast to a dungeon, a crypt, desolate ruins, or the wilderness.
These others can characterize the world through answers to the above primarily through environmental story telling, however they tend to be less focused on the current living people and their culture compared to an adventure in a settlement.
Of course, the wilds are quite alive with their ecology and ecosystem, but they typically lack a civilization.</p>
<p>We see this occur in various ways for existing adventures.</p>
<h2 id="some-patterns">Some Patterns</h2>
<p>I have noted some patterns from recounting my own experiences in playing settlement based adventures, as well as from my research in existing settlement focused games, settings, and adventures.
The main patterns I note are</p>
<ul>
<li>Settlements as a Dungeon,</li>
<li>Social Drama,</li>
<li>Slice of Life, and</li>
<li>Settlement Building,</li>
</ul>
<p>where the last three emphasize the living society the most.</p>
<h3 id="the-settlement-as-a-dungeon">The Settlement as a Dungeon</h3>
<p>Turn the typical formula of settlements as safe havens and dungeons as dangerous on its head.
Make the settlement be a dungeon!</p>
<ul>
<li>The classic settlement as a dungeon
<ul>
<li>settlement as ruins, post-apocalypse, or in enemy territory</li>
<li>besieged settlement</li>
<li>settlement invaded or overrun</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Change to a smaller perspective: Houses or other buildings become akin to dungeons for our small adventurers.</li>
<li>An inverted Bastionland: Where instead of the bastion being where you are safe, it is where you are in danger, yet you find yourself unfortunately within.
<ul>
<li>Similar to a reverse-dungeon where the adventurers must escape the city.</li>
<li>City where the citizens are turned into something like zombies</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="social-drama">Social Drama</h3>
<p>The tension that arises from social drama can make a very rich story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mystery
<ul>
<li>a popular adventure story pattern that makes up its own genre!</li>
<li>who-done-it?</li>
<li>murder mystery</li>
<li>frame the party or an important allied NPC</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Romance
<ul>
<li>Many different types of romance worth exploring. This is worth its own future post!</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Political Intrigue
<ul>
<li>times when power changes hands
<ul>
<li>voting, revolutions, coups</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>territory or resource grabs within the settlement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Occupational
<ul>
<li>commerce</li>
<li>Hazardous occupations: firefighters, small town law enforcement</li>
<li>Food: For example, a single <a rel="noopener" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakery#History">bakery</a> was pivotal to the food supply of a historical medieval town, as well as their cultural foods, such as a birthday cake or other holiday baked goods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="slice-of-life">Slice of Life</h3>
<p>A slice of life is a exactly a slice of a living society.
To observe and — in the case of roleplaying games — experience the people's way of life in their culture.
This emphasizes everyday living over the dramatic, tense moments of life, but these can be combined to create a captivating world!</p>
<h3 id="settlement-building">Settlement Building</h3>
<p>While this may be it own minigame in other games, and typically not an adventure in itself, these do share properties with such dedicated settlement building games that include a story to be told.
Microscope is one example of such a game.</p>
<h2 id="settlement-adventure-guidelines">Settlement Adventure Guidelines</h2>
<p>After identifying some properties of settlement adventures,
I now provide some guidelines to help create a settlement adventure.</p>
<ul>
<li>Focus on the people
<ul>
<li>Make factions with goals, and people with goals
<ul>
<li>esp. conflicting goals,</li>
<li>some of which should be petty goals when emphasizing the small scale concerns of those who live in the settlement.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Interacting with the people of the settlement should be rewarding
<ul>
<li>at least provide useful information to the objective or a direction to go to find more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A small settlement is able to be fully characterized by a complete cast of characters.</li>
<li>The local culture can shine and define a society
<ul>
<li>Taboos: Never wear a hat indoors, no idols, or do not tread dirt inside the house.</li>
<li>Etiquette: A proper bow, handshake, or the order in which you use your silverware.
<ul>
<li>Always greet someone with your name, title, and homeland.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engage with the societal structure
<ul>
<li>people within different occupations and different classes of society provide different perspectives.</li>
<li>be aware of power and resource flow through the societal structure
<ul>
<li>How could someone use this to further their goals or hinder another's?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Engage with a lived-in environment
<ul>
<li>environmental investigation</li>
<li>Who saw what? Who moved or misused the community well or ceremonial wheelbarrow?</li>
<li>Have the places be purposeful to their function and cultural value to the community</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paint in broad yet distinct strokes
<ul>
<li>the juxtaposition between the intent of a settlement and its use can be quite informative and flavorful, but it helps to provide a strong contrast between those things for them to be readily picked up in play.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Personally when planning character driven settings, I use Maslow's hierarchy of needs and address how the overall community sits on each point in this hierarchy, then the key factions and key people as necessary.
The base needs in the hierarchy that tend to be required prior to being able to satisfy the higher needs.
The hierarchy and some examples of each are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Physiological Needs</strong>: air, water, food, shelter, clothing, sleep</li>
<li><strong>Safety Needs</strong>: personal security, health &amp; well being, stable environment, financial security, safety nets</li>
<li><strong>Love &amp; Belonging</strong>: community, relationships, group membership, affection &amp; intimacy</li>
<li><strong>Esteem</strong>: Self-respect, confidence, respect from others, reputation, recognition and achievement</li>
<li><strong>Self-Actualization</strong>: creativity, personal growth, moral development, pursuit of purpose</li>
</ol>
<p>Higher level needs or wants can only be afforded if the lower levels are adequately met.
The starving artist must still eat to continue to exist and create.
However, some impassioned characters may sacrifice their own or other's base needs to achieve their higher needs in the short term.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>This was a good request and it turned out to relate to some of my prior interests that I've explored a bit before.
I did not include much if any of my prior work from those here and I will definitely write a survey and my thoughts on those in the future.
Those topics include game design for adventures in general, social drama and dynamics, mystery, political intrigue, and romance.</p>
<p>I hope my analysis is interesting and helps reveal some patterns that may be used in the design of settlement adventures!</p>

<h2 id="history-relevant-works">History &amp; Relevant Works</h2>
<p>It is worth exploring some history and prior works that have provided such adventures within the settlements themselves as I think they will provide nice examples and inspiration while also providing some insight into how to do this in a general way.
Most common are large scale settlements as cities and in general can even be treated as dungeons themselves.
Call of Cthulhu and the like also tend to provide some adventures for specific settlements or even single buildings, such as manors.
Of course, this list is not exhaustive and some of these can go beyond the scale I've placed them within.</p>
<h3 id="cities">Cities</h3>
<p>These tend to be essentially Megacities, which are expansive or even procedurally generated like Megadungeons.</p>
