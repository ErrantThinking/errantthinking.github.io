        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;discord.gg&#x2F;tsJ93PyuJH&quot;&gt;NSR Cauldron Discord&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, I wrote a community prompt in hopes that I could get a community effort to characterize Granny Jam, a character I made up who specializes in creating magical jams and jellies.
Under the pretense of creating magical jam and jelly items coupled with sharing stories of a time when Granny Jam used those jams, I was hoping we would discover the emergent character of Granny Jam and come to a better understanding of who she is as more people shared (made up) stories about her and her wares.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It never took off, but I do love the initial concept of Granny Jam and this idea for emergent characters from collaborative prompts.
I wanted to share her here, at least through what I originally wrote up for the collaborative prompts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
