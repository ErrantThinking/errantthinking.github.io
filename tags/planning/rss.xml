          <description xml:base="https://errantthinking.com/what-we-thinking/">&lt;p&gt;As with everyone, let alone bloggers, life can grab you by the collar and you just gotta run with it!
With my hectic life aside, I feel it is appropriate to set some expectations for what kind of content I &lt;em&gt;intend&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; to write here, along with a brief introduction.
Even if it is mostly to motivate myself to check off some boxes in the future, heheh.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am Errant and I think about &lt;em&gt;many&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; things!
In my daily life, I am a computer scientist.
I research topics, analyze problems, design mathematical models &amp;amp; develop algorithmic solutions!
Here, I will do the same for my hobbies, sharing more freeform thoughts that occur over time as I learn, and revising some pages as a wiki for the refined concepts.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
