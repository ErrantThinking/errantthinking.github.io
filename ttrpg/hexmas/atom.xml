Where the mountains meet the coastline Haggard&#x27;s Stronghold stubbornly resits the crashing waves of the Swirly Twirly Sea of Gumdrops.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last candy cane caribou is somewhere in the North Pole, and is on a journey to find if she really is the last of her kind.
This hex is her final destination where all her questions will finally be answered.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I created a Rankin&#x2F;Bass inspired creature that dwells in flocks among the mountain tops.
This creature is the &lt;strong&gt;Ramkin&lt;&#x2F;strong&gt;, an intelligent yet primitive being with a ram&#x27;s head and curling horns as well as a ram&#x27;s hind legs.
The ramkin&#x27;s upper body is like that of a gorilla, muscular and in this case wool covered.
Their hefty fists on their gorilla like arms are covered in keratin like their hooves, which protects their knuckles, and they have opposable thumbs with their two large and thick fingers which are plated in that keratin.
They can grip and climb with their hands as well as walk and run on them as if hooves.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

A relatively peaceful snowfield featuring multiple towns including Snowville, a village of cold elementals which neighbors the Snow Henge.
January Junction makes an appearance along with Snowdin, inspired from Undertale.
Also features  Keh Night Automata and a twisted Cult of Janus.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

the Rime Ridge, a dense mountain range thick with fog that tends to freeze into hard rime ice upon all surfaces.
An icey mist covered mountain range inspired by the Misty Mountains of Rankin&#x2F;Bass&#x27;s films 1977 &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and 1964 &quot;Rudolph&#x27;s Shiny New Year&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

        <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;A jagged mountain range that features a long dormant volcano, Mount Heart, with a frozen spire at its top. The hollowed out volcano that was once mined for its riches and resources is now abandoned. Perhaps due to the dark secrets within its depths?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is inspired by the Mines of Moria from &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; as well as
the Rankin&#x2F;Bass films &quot;The Hobbit&quot;, &quot;Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King&quot;,
&quot;Jack Frost&quot;, and
&quot;Rudolph and Frosty&#x27;s Christmas in July&quot;.
Extra inspiration comes from Disney&#x27;s movie Frozen and the 1844 &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; by Hans Christian Andersen.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

Hexmas&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
where he calls for bloggers to create multiple hexes within a shared world
inspired by the thematic &lt;a rel=&quot;noopener&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Rankin&#x2F;Bass_Animated_Entertainment&quot;&gt;Christmas cinematic universe of Rankin and Bass&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;,
such as the stop motion &quot;Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer&quot; and the animated &quot;Frosty the Snowman&quot;.
Rankin&#x2F;Bass are also responsible for various other animations and stop motion films, including the original Lord of the Rings &quot;Hobbit&quot; and &quot;Return of the King&quot; animated films.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this, I provide four hexes to join the existing others, each of which I shall briefly detail here and then later on further refine and develop in their own blog post each following this one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
