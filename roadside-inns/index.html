<p>Excellent! I have chosen a <strong>d20</strong>.
I've also chosen to include some taverns or pubs without the expected option of lodging.
I have also thrown in a few in-city locations.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h2 id="roadside-inns-taverns">Roadside Inns &amp; Taverns</h2>
<p>For each, I'll specify:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> of the Inn or Tavern</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> of the Inn, its surroundings or ideal surroundings, besides being on a road. Feel free to ignore this and use them where ever.</li>
<li><strong>Keeper</strong> of the Inn, i.e., the owner.</li>
<li>Type of <strong>Building</strong></li>
<li>a <strong>Quirk</strong></li>
<li>a <strong>Secret</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>Description</strong> for more flavor</li>
</ul>
<p>Feel free to adapt these as you see fit.</p>
