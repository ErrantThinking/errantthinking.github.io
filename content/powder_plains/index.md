As part of [Prismatic Wasteland's Rankin/Bass-themed 2025 Merry Hexmas](@/hexmas_2025/index.md), I've contributed the Powder Plains as a snowfield hex.
A relatively peaceful snowfield featuring multiple towns including Snowville, a village of cold elementals which neighbors the Snow Henge.
January Junction makes an appearance along with Snowdin, inspired from Undertale.

## Powder Plains

A mostly peaceful hex that features a few towns.
Features January Junction, Cold-based elementals, Keh Night Automata, and a Cult of Janus.

## Weather of Powder Plains

Cold and always snow covered.

1. Clear skies
    - If daytime, snowblindness can occur
2. Light clouds, no snow
3. Light snow, what snow?
4. Light snow, oh so fluffy
5. Heavy fluffy snow
6. White-out Blizzard

### Roaming Characters from the Powder Plains

- [Cold-based Elementals](@/oh_no_its_snow/index.md)
    - **Sam the Snowman**: A town-to-town travelling bard.
- **Keh Nights** diesel punk automata (attempt to) roam the areas of this hex and its neighbors, lost, and attempting to serve a purpose now long gone.
    - Some frozen Keh Night scouts are found by chance. Froze as they attempted to fulfill their long futile directives.
    - These are smoky coal or other combustion powered automata.
    - Crude, inelegant, however they can get the job done.
    - The ruins of Kubla Kraus' castle are *not* in the Powder Plains.
    - Some Keh Nights have *Two Faces* instead of one. These ones move more purposefully, and even command other Keh Nights with new directives
        - More graceful. More purposeful.
        - Seem more like puppets marionetted by shadows and smoke plumes
        - Few may even seem sentient
        - Rumor: *Heart of Darkness*: A darkness beneath the stolen heart spreads out to fill not only its void, but all the lands. It's reach is subtle, but the Powder Plains are within its grasp.

### Locations within the Powder Plains

- The ruins of Kubla Kraus' castle are *not* in the Powder Plains.
- **January Junction**: A poor human town whose folklore celebrate the beginnings and the ending of things. They celebrate the liminality of life's journey.
    - History: suffered from subjugation by the King Kubla Kraus.
    - Snip's Tailor Shop is well known in the North Pole.
    - Other features, basic town amenities, taverns, inns, library, guardsmen, fishermen, hunters, miners.
    - The crestfallen **Sir Raveneau**, a widower
        - A renowned Gold Knight hails from this town, said to have served King Arthur!
        - In his midlife, past his youthful vibrancy, but still surprisingly vigorous, that is if his spirit wasn't broken.
        - Lost his wife, Elisa, to a monster attack.
        - In a rut, though if you or the Cult of Janus get to him, he could be up and swinging that sword in no time! ...But at who?
    - A *twisted* Cult of Janus
        - **Dominic Subter** is a seedy, slimey fellow, He has quests for adventures that pay handsomely.
            - Think Grima Wormtongue from "The Lord of the Rings".
            - Will steer people towards the glory of Janus, to end their old ways that fetter them down, and open them to new beginnings.  A beginning where they no longer need to fear the dark. A promising pitch in a world where there are very real horros in neighboring hexes!
        - **Sady Mason**: One of the villagers with their head on right.  Takes care of others. Sees the world clearly for what it is and make plans to help the town and people. However sound her logic seems, she has a twisted perspective due to her past experiences.
            - Devoted demon worshiper or otherwise has some dark twist to emphasize 2 faces.

- **Snowdin**: A small and peaceful monster settlement. They have a prominent folkoric history of settling down and founding the town after being freed from a dreadful underworld. Upon being freed, they learned what it meant to be misfits in this world.
    - Yes, this is an [Undertale reference](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Snowdin)
    - Bunny People, Dinosaur people, Fish people, Dogs, Dog/wolf people, Venus Man Eating Trap monsters (think Little Shop of Horrors), skeletons (yeah the source of em is an open question they don't know the answer to either)
        - Simply take the cast from Undertale's Snowdin if you need characters or mosnter ideas.
    - Known for an _incredible local bakery_, one of their specialties being powedered doughnuts.
        - run by **Arachne**, a female monstrous spider with a humanoid torso, head, and two human arms among her other 6 spider arms. Her human face has eight spider eyes instead of human and notably sharp and curved fangs.
        - A shrewd, yet charismatic business woman
            - "Honey catches more flies than vinegar."
        - Some of her special treats are able to provide foresight
        - Can perform a divination at a cost
        - Likes tea, crumpets, and all baked goods
        - Has a daughter named Muffet
    - Features a "Snowed Inn", a general store, a library, "Grillby's" diner, several houses, a town center with a Christmas tree, and a nearby lake fileld by the Sleeping Slopes that drains into a stream that flows southwest into the Vorpal Vale.
        - **Grillby** is a Fire Elemental in humanoid form.
        - The general store sells polarized sunglasses, which help against snow blindness.

- **Snowville**: Nearby to the Snow Henge is a village featuring entirely [Cold Elementals](@/oh_no_its_snow/index.md).
    - Perhaps Sam the Snowman has family or friends here?
    - Frosty the Snowman & family settled down in Snowville
    - Note that these Cold Elementals are influenced by the local emotions of living beings. If the people are afraid, then the elementals are too and will become frightening and territorial to ward off danger.
        - Fight, Flight, _Freeze_
        - They are physical manifestations of the spirit of the locals. The good, the bad, the ugly.
    - Offers the best snow cones and shaved ice you've ever had!
    - **Rumors**
        - There is a terrible rumor of a *Tooth Fairy* who's victims are forced to have all their teeth yanked from their jaw.
            - Fortunately, no one in Snowdin had an encounter with this tooth fairy _yet_.
        - "The Dark Year" is hunting for "Happy" New Year. The babe's gone missing. His twisted clockwork horrors hunt tirelessly, without rest.

- **Snow Henge**: circular dip is surrounded by multiple rings formed by carved stones stacked atop each other.
Some form archways, others form thick rising pillars.
All have runes and different humanoid or animal features carved into and out of them.
    - Snow, _the_ [Snow Elemental](@/oh_no_its_snow/index.md)
    - New snow elementals emerge from this henge, although it is unknown how or why
    - Those who desecrate the henge face the wrath of Snow & his people.
    - A graveyard exists on one side of the henge where people who either worshipped or felt close with the nature of these elementals chose to reside for eternety
    - The henge with proper resources and a well executed ritual could create an "Heart of Ice", which is a brilliant-gemstone-cut pseudo-Everice the size of a basketball.
        - _Everice_ is ice taken from the *Bifrost* and is inherently magical, useful as a medium for ice spells. Only those who traverse the Bifrost or walk the branches of Yggdrasil can access the Everice for harvesting.
        - This "Heart of Ice" is not as strong as a true "Heart of Everice".
        - Dependent upon the emotional state of those at the time of creation.
