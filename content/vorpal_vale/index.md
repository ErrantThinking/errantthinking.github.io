## Terrain and Biome

A steep valley between the mountains in the north and south featuring its own bumpy hills with a winding river that traverses between those hills.
The primary stream starts from streams and drainage of melting ice (when it does melt) from the northeastern Powder Plains.
The water from the mountains accumulates in the valley forming various small lakes and ponds and streams that drain into the main winding river which exits this hex westward towards the ocean.
The clouds that accumulate from the ocean against Rime Ridge results in the heavy rains over The Green Chapel and its fields, and also in a thick fog that is nearly always present in the Vorpal Vale.
People get lost in this misty vale and many mysteries dwell within.

## Weather

1d10 : if 10, then there is **no** fog, otherwise there is fog.

If it is foggy, then 1d20 for snow: 1 to 10: no snow, 11 to 19: snow, 20. blizzard.
If it snows or blizzards while there is a fog, this results in a freezing fog where the fog will freeze to surfaces forming [rime ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rime_ice).
If it is snowing, then low winds and soft rime ice is formed.
If it is blizzarding, then high winds and hard rime ice is formed.
Getting caught in a blizzard may require finding or making shelter.

Cannot get lost in the fog when you have someone like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer guiding your way!

## Rumors of Vorpal Vale

A headless knight in green prowls the vale at night. They call him Chevalier Vert. It is said he hunts for his missing head and disappears into a mist at dawn.
Some say there is a sacred scroll in the Green Chapel that can be used to control him.
Others say if his head were to be returned to him, his wild spirit would finally know peace.

He is said to carry a vorpal sword that could fell the great Jabberwocky.
Too bad his gear along with himself all turns to mist at dawn!

## Random Encounters
There is a Vorpal Vale counter which accounts accumulation of the Vorpal Vale's curse on travellers.
If the Vorpal Vale counter is less than four *after* incrementing, then nothing happens.
If that is dissapointing, then choose an encounter or roll again.
On the fourth count, reset the counter to zero and all of the following occurs:
- Fog pours over Rime Ridge into the vale.
- Vorpal Veil occurs.
- Encounter 3x Daytime or Nighttime Roamers given the time of day.
