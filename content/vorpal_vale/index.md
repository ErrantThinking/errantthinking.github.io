## Terrain and Biome

A steep valley between the mountains in the north and south featuring its own bumpy hills with a winding river that traverses between those hills.
The primary stream starts from streams and drainage of melting ice (when it does melt) from the northeastern Powder Plains.
The water from the mountains accumulates in the valley forming various small lakes and ponds and streams that drain into the main winding river which exits this hex westward towards the ocean.
The clouds that accumulate from the ocean against Rime Ridge results in the heavy rains over The Green Chapel and its fields, and also in a thick fog that is nearly always present in the Vorpal Vale.
People get lost in this misty vale and many mysteries dwell within.

### Weather

1d10 : if 10, then there is **no** fog, otherwise there is fog.

If it is foggy, then 1d20 for snow: 1 to 10: no snow, 11 to 19: snow, 20. blizzard.
If it snows or blizzards while there is a fog, this results in a freezing fog where the fog will freeze to surfaces forming [rime ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rime_ice).
If it is snowing, then low winds form soft rime ice.
If a blizzard occurs, then high winds form hard rime ice.
Getting caught in a blizzard may require finding or making shelter, otherwise it slows travel and tests ones survival.

Cannot get lost in the fog when you have someone like Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer guiding your way!

## Rumors of the Vorpal Vale

The road from the Powder Plains to here has a battered wooden sign that reads:

>Danger! Beware the Vorpal Vale's mists! Keep your head on straight!

This road follows the banks of the winding river through the vale.

### The Chevalier Vert

A headless knight in green prowls the vale at night riding atop a large [boreal woodland caribou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boreal_woodland_caribou).
They call him **Chevalier Vert**.
It is said he hunts in a frenzy for his missing head and helm all through the night.
Yet once dawn strikes, he disappears into a mist.

Some say there is a *sacred scroll* in the *Chapel of the Green* that can be used to control him.
Others say if his head were to be returned to him, his wild spirit would finally know peace.

He is said to carry a vorpal sword that could cut clean the head of the great Jabberwock in a single snicker-snack!
Too bad his gear along with himself all turn to mist at dawn!

Chevvalier Vert was known to wear a magnificient antlered helm.
However, he lost it prior to losing his head in the Vorpal Vale.
There are rumors of a [Yule Barbarian](https://playtestdummies.substack.com/p/merry-hexmas-the-christmas-tree-forest), more westward than north of the vale, who possesses such an antlered helm.
They say to "seek a henge of a dozen".

#### Upon Return of his Head

The Chevalier Vert will regain his sanity and cease his frenzy upon the return of his head.
He is now able to escort the party with his faithful mount during the evening.
However, until he regains his antlered helm, he cannot aid the party during the day.

He'll tell the tale of how he lost his head here due to not wearing him great antlered helm.
He lost his helm in a great fight against demonic wind mill.
He swears it was a great foe.

Once he is whole again with both his head and helm, he can reattach his helmed head and be free from his misty bonds to the Vorpal Vale.

### The Jabberwock

The Jabberwock is known to visit the Vorpal Vale during the day to prey upon those lost.

## Random Encounters

The Vorpal Vale is a common path of travel in part due to it not being as long, laborious, and dangerous (relatively) as travelling through the adjacent mountains.
You'll often meet other travelers on the road.

### The Curse of the Vorpal Vale

There is a Curse of the Vorpal Vale which accumulates upon travellers.
Treat the curse as a counter for the adventurers that starts at zero and increments when specified in the random encounters below.
If the Vorpal Vale Curse is less than four *after* incrementing, then nothing happens.
If that is disappointing, then choose an encounter or roll again.
On the fourth count, reset the counter to zero and *all* of the following occurs:
- Fog pours over Rime Ridge into the vale.
- Vorpal Veil occurs.
- Encounter 3x Daytime or Nighttime Roamers given the time of day.
    - If night and not yet encountered, encounter the **Chevalier Vert** as one of these encountered roamers.

## Locations within the Vorpal Vale

- Misty still waters
    - Bassians (pronounced as the Bass fish)
    - Some are so still their reflections are like mirrors, even when frozen.
    - From these mirror like pools the Jabberwock is said to emerge during the day and retreat during the night.

- Somewhere in the Vorpal Vale is the Chevalier Vert's head.
   - If the party attempts to search for it they have chance of finding the one of many misty still waters in which the head is submerged.
   - A 1 on the following dice results in finiding the correct location, where the next one die smaller is used for every attempt until 1d1.
   - 1d20, 1d12, 1d10, 1d8, 1d6, 1d4, 1d2, 1d1
   - Each time the adventurers get lost due to the **Vorpal Veil**, the die size decreases improving their odds. Perhaps even the spirits of the Vale pity the poor Chevalier Vert?
