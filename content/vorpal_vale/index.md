## Vorpal Vale

A steep valley between the mountains in the north and south featuring its own bumpy hills with a winding river that traverses between those hills.
The primary stream starts from streams and drainage of melting ice (when it does melt) from the northeastern Powder Plains.
The water from the mountains accumulates in the valley forming various small lakes and ponds and streams that drain into the main winding river which exits this hex westward towards the ocean.
The clouds that accumulate from the ocean against Rime Ridge results in the heavy rains over The Green Chapel and its fields, and also in a thick fog that is nearly always present in the Vorpal Vale.
People get lost in this misty vale and many mysteries dwell within.
