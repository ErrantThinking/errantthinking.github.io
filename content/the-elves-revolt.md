I told myself I'd setup my blog this year, and with the year coming to a close I thought I'd finally make that happen.
I decided to sign up for some external accountability in the form of something called the 2024 Secret Santicorn.
This is a yearly event hosted by [Archon](https://archons-court.blogspot.com/) in the Old School Renaissance (OSR) Discord, which is a community focused on Tabletop Roleplaying Games (TTRPGs) that revitalizes the old school games in a modern way.
That's the [OSR](https://lithyscaphe.blogspot.com/p/principia-apocrypha.html) part.
Secret Santicorn is essentially a secret Santa for blogging where everyone submits a writing prompt, the prompts get shuffled, and each person writes a blog in response to the prompt they received.

## The Prompt

I was given [The Robgoblin](https://the-robgoblin.blogspot.com/)'s prompt where [he notes](https://the-robgoblin.blogspot.com/2024/12/1d6-celestial-phenomena.html) that Goblette (Goblina?) conceived the original idea of the Christmas elves forming a trade union. The prompt is:

>The Elves are revolting: class struggle at the North Pole.

<!-- more -->

I admittedly thought much longer on this than I thought I would have, and I have delved deep into the lore of Santa Claus, his elves, and the North Pole.
For this prompt, I have decided to write bits of a setting and pieces for a short adventure.
I consider worldbuilding throughout and in the very end the [adventure checklist](@/the-elves-revolt.md#the-adventure-begins).
I intend this to be system agnostic as I focus on the narrative elements, although I will be considering primarily a medieval fantasy setting with some folkloric magic.
I'm sure it will fit in most fantasy OSR games and Dungeons and Dragons (D&D) editions.
<!--While magic is certainly included, I considered physics and technology to help ground the folklore of Santa Claus and his fabled workshop, but expect this to be a folkloric fantasy.
If you desire science instead of magic for a science fiction or cyberpunk setting, then feel free to adapt as necessary, but do note that I make no promises about obeying the physical laws of the real world.
Remember, magic can nearly always be replaced with appropriate technology for sci-fi or cyberpunk settings!-->

Lets start with what this prompt gives us and we will  "[Yes! And ...](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yes,_and...)" from there.

- **Who?** The elves and whom they revolt against. I include the Claus family, upper, middle, and lower classes of elves, the misfits to the Claus mission, and the outsiders who are the Christmas present recipients.
- **What?** A class struggle brews an Christmas elf trade union or revolution where I've chosen it to be against the big man in red, the Claus family, and the upper class elves, that is, the elves in top management and whom benefit the most from the current system that is the Claus community.
- **When?** Unspecified. Lets have this occur after at least  a century or two of Christmas deliveries and be in early December, or an equivalent time prior to the winter solstice in your world's northern hemisphere. A dire time for any strike or revolution that could severely impact the year's Christmas delivery.
- **Where?** At the "North Pole" in the Arctic. I base it on the real world Arctic, but feel free to adjust as necessary. This is a partially land locked ocean covered in [drift ice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drift_ice), which makes it difficult to satisfy basic needs. A harsh environment where only the fittest survive.
We primarily focus on the Santa's primary workshop and consider [the various locations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Santa_Claus#Home) where many modern day northern countries consider the North Pole or his workshop to reside.
- **Why?**  Unspecified. This involves the crucial pieces that make sense of the revolution! I'll cover the main factions and characters in play along with their motivations.
- **How?** Unspecified. Strike, revolt, or submit? Options detailed below, albeit ultimately determined by the players' actions!


I will attempt to flesh out each question above along with considering the motivations of the key characters and their factions, which here correspond mostly to the classes in this struggle.
After the setup, rumors and hints will be specified to help lead the players through the role of mediator, whether peaceful or -- not so much.
Such rumors and hints are intended to be learned by the players eventually, and so the GM will reveal them in a reasonable manner.

I'm going to just have fun and mess with the names and folklore here, intending to respect the originals, but nonetheless play with the lack of clarity of concepts to meld them together to make something different.
I personally enjoy intertwining such folklore things by where they could connect as some kind of counterfactual.
Notably I make up a name for the Christmas elves as the "hulderálfar", which literally means "hidden elves".


### A Pitch

Every game needs pitched to the players to gauge interest.
So, I begin with a hook of one such possible introductions, under the pretense of this being a holiday adventure that navigates the volatile formation of a Christmas elf trade union, or worse, a revolution  against Saint Nick himself:

> Tis winter and snow falls heavy upon the frozen ground.
    Everywhere you look, people hide in their dwellings, stoking fires to keep the ice sprites from stealing their warmth.
    As per tradition, the Yuletide festivities turn from mere whispers to comforting beginnings that warms the spirit within one's frigid frame.
>
> However, on one particularly long and stormy night, where the outside was made impenetrable by snow and ice, you swore you heard the ruckus of hooves and the jeers of men softly carried by the wind upon your doorstep.
    Surely not, you thought, for in the midst of this night, none could fathom such a ride.
    And thus you slept, shivering yet, but as dawn broke and you awoke, you found yourself not in the comfort of your abode, but in a bed of snow.
>
>   You stir amidst others lost in a daze as your eyes adjust to the snowblinding haze.
    Before you stands a boy -- nay, a man -- cross armed and hooded, he stood yet rooted
    upon the ice; firmly he stands.
    Whilst he's no taller than a boy, let alone a man, his eyes of ice hold you like a vice as his voice surprises you yet again.
    "You've been summoned to join the hunt of Jolnir. Not the wild hunt of yesteryear, nor the years before that, but the hunt *of* Jolnir; to end the frenzied man."

## The Northern Folk

Before we get to the core of the adventure and class struggle, lets get acquainted with the northern folk.
Besides the humans and other common species in the frigid north, there are a few whom the folktales never fail to mention.
Feel free to include any other fae mentioned in the folklore about the north.

*If you're short on time like the man in red*, simply know that
    the Christmas elves are the hulderálfar and are distinct from the typical fantasy elf,
    there are various polar fae all about who are said to traverse the aurora borealis,
    and the snow folk are spirits that dwell within the ice.
Next is [the fabled man in red & his mission](@/the-elves-revolt.md#the-fabled-man-in-red-his-mission).

### The Hulderálfar

The renowned Christmas elves are a type of fae that go by another name, which we shall make use of here to differentiate them from your typical fantasy elf, a Ljósálfr, like Legolas of Tolkein's *Lord of the Rings*.
We first introduce the huldufolk, literally "hidden folk", such as gnomes, brownies, and the like all of whom are superb at hiding and typically of shorter stature.
The Christmas elves are a type of huldufolk known as the hulderálfar, which translates literally into the common mortal tongue as "hidden elf".
They are the result of the intermingling of various fae, primarily including the álfar and huldufolk.

Hulderálfar are recognized by their small stature, vivid colored eyes with hues from the aurora borealis they traverse, and sharp pointy ears that stick out near perpendicularly from the sides of their heads.
Some say the álfar ethereal beauty in their blood provides their flawless skin, rosy cheeks, and expressive demeanor.
Most hulderálfr cultures appreciate aesthetics and will often decorate their living quarters and things along with themselves if they can.
Some of the males sport beards or mustaches, typically well groomed as their daily living can allow.
Their musculature varies greatly on their day-to-day to activities.
While rarely equivalent to that of your average dwarf, they certainly can put on some bulk under the right conditions.

Not all of the hulderálfar joined Santa Claus on his mission.
Some remain in their realm, others spread across the north, and some have even ventured south.
They are free spirited after all.

### The Polar Fae

Not only are there more huldufolk, there are even more polar fae.
The polar fae are the northern variety of fae who over the years have evolved or survived the harsh and unforgiving cold.
It is said they hail from a place in the heavens where a network of branching bridges of light trailing in the sky allows them to cross between not only our realm and theirs, but also move quickly over the earth to wherever those northern lights reach.
To freely traverse the world tree, askr Yggdrasils, is a blessing indeed.

We have already mentioned some of the polar fae, such as the **ice sprites** who are mischievous lil' buggers.
These impish pixies be merry, sure, but in their fun you may lose not only your much needed coal and cinders, but could even lose yourself if you stray too far into the cold with these sprites.

**Frost giants** are giant humans with long limbs who've acclimated to the frigid cold so much that it is said that their blood runs hot!
Easily agitated, but rather seclusive,
    they mostly are nomadic herders of woolly mammoths who keep to themselves.
Some say they are aware of their natural disposition and practice isolation and stoicism to avoid unnecessary conflict.
The tales say they are experts in carving the mountains and land and that they can pluck an ice block from the ocean and carry it upon their bare backs.

The **yetis** are akin to the trolls in the south, but their hide is thick and covered in long fur.
Smaller than the giants but their hulking form can still tower over a human when not curled over on all fours.
Like their southern counterparts, yetis fear fire as it harms them greatly and puts a stop to their unnatural resilience.
Yetis love a good cavern to live in and to ambush a frequented passage for their next meal or  entertainment.
Perhaps surprisingly, they also are excellent swimmers and will hunt on the drift ice.

The **woolly fauns** are humanoids with goat legs, short tail, and atop their heads are the thick curling horns of a ram.
As their name suggests, their fur coat is much like that of a woolly mammoth's with long guard hairs and a curly under-wool, fit for the frigid environment.
Their nose is like that of a goat or ram.
Their small frame hidden under fur and clothes may lead the unwary to miss their thick sinew that enables their great strength and speed.
Their cloven hooves and bones tend to be larger than their southern kin, whose first impression of the woolly faun may be that they were born for war and hard labor.


### The Snow Folk

Amidst the mortals and the polar fae, there are other spirits big and small who dwell within the snow.
Some may know these spirits as ice elementals, beings of living ice, but did you know they are quite varied?
Some are made of solid ice and sit upon the icebergs or float peacefully among the drift ice.
Others are made of snow where they shift from an amorphous form into snowmen or whirl with the wind and reform at their leisure.

Much like the simplest of the fae, yet even more so, the snow folk are easily moved by the emotions of neighboring creatures and empathetically mirror those around them.
I suppose we all have a bit of that in us, no?
Our environment and the company we keep certainly affects us in nuanced ways.



## The Fabled Man in Red & His Mission
___

:warning: **Player Warning!** :warning:
The rest is written for the Game Master (GM), so all secrets will be made apparent.
**If you are a player, beware that reading further will spoil the story!**
___

Santa Claus is known by many names.
His common names include Saint Nicholas and its derivatives such as the Dutch name Sinterklaus and from that Santa Claus.
Some others being Father Christmas and Jolnir, or the "Yule One".
Speaking of Jolnir, there is another whom is known by many names and hails from northern lands.
That is Odin of Norse mythology.
Our Santa Claus here is a saint and a cleric now, or at least on his path to true sainthood as the jolly Santa Claus we all know so well, but much like Odin and the Nordic people, his path to sainthood was a tumultuous journey not without sin.
Indeed, much like the mythological Odin, Nicholas at first sought power and knowledge beyond all else and his visage often earned the title of the "frenzied one", along with his frenzied followers.

This is why the timing of **when** this adventure takes place is paramount.
This adventure takes place where Santa's past actions still haunt him as he works to become  Saint Nick and bring Christmas cheer to the masses.
He is not a flawless figure, but one who is actively seeking to better himself and help others.

### The Beginnings of Saint Nick

- The wise man fooled by a wiser hulderálfr.
- A promise made to spread good cheer along the hunt for the base of Yggdrasil
    - where its roots meet its trunk.
- Power greater than ten thousand men and knowledge beyond any fellow man, was his promised reward at the end of this pilgrimage.
    - In addition, at the end, Santa would be given the power to not only traverse Yggdrasil over Earth, but also enter the Fae's home across the Bifröst.
- To show good faith, he was given immortality conditioned on his continuation of this pilgrimage.
- Charismatic from the beginning, his frenzied followers joined him, but over the years frenzy softened into compassion.
- For the arctic is harsh and difficult, so to be harsh to those you depend upon only splinters and shatters the union.
    - And the strength of many vanishes in disarray.
- Fear is not the answer for they will turn on you or from you, all the same, from this only a loss can be claimed.
- Not soon enough, he came to realize that empathy, not just logically emulated but true understanding, was the answer to proper rule and unification of man
- Many a lesson hard learned over lifetimes or more, and from this born a fledgling saint.

And so here we are today.
Santa Claus has successfully kept his promise of spreading good cheer on a yearly basis as he hunts the northern ocean for the base of the world tree.
Tantalizingly close this whole time he often sees its branches across the night sky.
The hulderálfar who join him even able to walk along its rainbow branches.

His reindeer? Fae-touched stags who can run along those branches with ease.
While he has traversed the branches along his fae-blessed sleigh, it takes great energy and his hunt for Yggdrasil's base never ends.
By now he begins to believe he was tricked, but he is dependent upon the conditional immortality and from his experience he has started to see the possibility of power greater than ten thousand men and a wisdom unmatched by his fellow man.

He has an elven wife who is as fierce as he is or more.
Mrs. Freya Claus blessed him with children whom he adores and whom he teaches all he's learned.
His children have gone into the family business and tend to local outposts that have previously served as his workshop as he hunted along the northern coasts.


### Santa Claus' Problem

Everything seems pretty dandy for Santa.
He has kept his promise and lives longer than any human, he's grown his operations to command many and spread cheer at a wondrous scale, he's experienced and learned much from his pilgrimage, he's known all across the lands, has greatly emotionally matured, has a lovely family, and something worth living for!

However, he faces an issue he never had before.
The *problem of scale*.
His resources and reach are spread thin as he has to ensure his people are well taken care of and are able to carry out their part in the joint mission of Yuletide.
In his dedication to his mission, originally born out of his selfishness and thirst for power, he has spread too fast and now is faced with issues in ensuring his community's survival and quality of life for which he is responsible.

There are inherent tensions that every community faces when the original people came together for one mission.
- Has that mission changed or have their expectations not been met?
- What of those who have changed their mind and wish to carry on outside of Santa's community?
- What of those who were born into this and have pressures to remain in the community for a mission they were born into rather than agreed upon in full understanding?

This is not even considering those who feel spurred by Santa for the mission is no longer that of frenzy and expanse by force, but is that of spreading cheer, which is seen by some as a weakness and betrayal of their blood-steeped honor.
Furthermore, how do people remember these people now against this meek mission?

We find ourselves at a critical time for the annual Yuletide operation.
If the people, especially the working class that mostly consists of the hulderálfar, cannot have a proper quality of life or even survive, then Santa's people will diminish and so will the mission.

> GM, I recommend revealing the history of Santa Claus to the players gradually over time from different sources.
It can be a source of suspense and intrigue of are we working with a terrible or good man.
If you or your table are more interested in a different rendition of Santa Claus than the one I have portrayed here, then by all means adjust the material as you see fit!

## The Classes & Their Discord

We cannot have a class struggle without any classes!
In descending order of power within the community as well as descending satisfaction of general physiological and psychological needs:

1. Santa Claus
2. The Claus Family
3. Upper class hulderálfar
4. Middle class hulderálfar
5. Lower class hulderálfar
6. Fit, but left
7. The Misfits
    - Unaccepting, but remain
    - Accepting, and left

The primary group struggling consists of the Lower and Middle classes of hulderálfar along with the Misfits who have remained.
They struggle against the Upper class and Claus family, where in our story the upper class has some improper management and exploitation, but not all of them are like this.
The Claus family in our instance is doing their best with what little resources and energy they have.
Perhaps their primary fault lies in not letting somethings go or fester briefly in order to restructure the hulderálfar classes to fix the tilted scales and rebalance power among their workers.
Fundamentally, this community lacks any means of revenue as they entirely are a non-profit venture that provides only charity.
Thus the resources they need are left up to them to acquire or to bargain with others through means of trading their services or crafts.
So perhaps, they should be a toy store for the majority of the year to acquire revenue, but in our story they certainly have not gotten stable enough  neither as an organization nor in their available trade routes to establish something like that yet.
Such a commercial materialistic business probably wouldn't excel in the pre-medieval times anyways where getting coal *is* a grand gift in a frigid winter, although I may not be fully appreciating how much the powerful and rich nobles could pay to support such a toymaker.

## The Key Characters

You all know Saint Nick, of course, but what of his family, his trusty elves, and other companions?
What of the fairies and snow spirits that dwell in the north?

### The Claus Family

The primary family member to be included if any would be Mrs. Claus as she can provide a more intimate perspective of Santa Claus to the players.
She has a big heart and cares for the hulderálfar and others who work towards the Yuletide mission.

I envision Santa Claus to have at least a few children and given our chosen emphasis on Santa as Odin, we can make one at least be Thor or have his essence.
Give him a chariot pulled by fae-touched goats as per the [Poetic Edda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tanngrisnir_and_Tanngnj%C3%B3str).
If you want a darker character who oppresses others, then make the goats woolly fauns.

>GM, unless your table is aiming for a collapse of Santa's operations, having the children be problems that need the PCs help to resolve will probably result in a longer number of sessions, unless they are made to be the core issue and are easily accessible.

### Twinklety the Unionizer

Twinklety is a female hulderálfr born into this community in the middle class who seeks to form a trade union of the hulderálfr and other workers.
United they can all come together and improve the current situation for everyone while ensuring Yuletide festivities continue.
She recognizes that compromises will have to occur, but also knows that everyone is here for a single mission, to spread good will and cheer in a cold season of a life of turmoil.
A flaw of hers is that she does not consider those who want to leave or those who do not wish to commit themselves to that mission.
She is quite jovial, cheery, and optimistic.
Mrs. Claus is fond of Twinklety's innocence and hope, although she recognizes Twinklety's naivety at times.
For Mrs. Claus knows well what it is like to struggle and fight to survive.


### Beltznickle the Starry Eyed, a Middle Class Hulderálfr

Once known for joining in the intimidation and negative reinforcement practices of Yuletide, Beltznickle has grown weary of such tactics and has witnessed the flawed learnings from such a method of teaching.
He now serves well as a middle class hulderálfr crafting toys and tools or acquiring and refining materials to be used in such crafts.
Beltznickle is a gruff hulderálfr with a deep resonant voice.

His efforts in acquiring resources such as lumber and coal have resulted in his physique to be quite muscular, and ironically more intimidating than before.
His eyes are two toned with a central heterochromia of light blue that stands out stark against the midnight blue base color of his irises.
Several light blue specks are evident in his eyes, which earned him his title as Beltznickle the starry eyed.
He has a thick mustache that curls at its ends into light swirls in front of his cheeks, and his face is otherwise clean shaven.
He wears layers of thick fur, especially when going out in the cold to gather resources.

Beltznickle is tired of the exhaustion from his and his fellow workers' efforts to actualize Yuletide delivery along with hunting for where the base of Yggdrasil meets the Earth.
He believes the workers are overworked and need more rest and respectful consideration of their needs.
He believes this enough to be one of the most vocal and evident revolutionists.
He has no quarrel with Saint Nick, and if the conditions were to improve, he'd be quite satisfied.
The issue is conditions have not improved for years now, and something needs to change.

### Krampus, the Misfit

Krampus is one of Santa Claus' frequent companions in the past and is associated with the less saintly actions of scaring children into behaving well by making example of the badly behaved ones by beating them with a birch rod.
Krampus has also been said to abduct poorly behaved children to work in Santa's workshop as punishment for their bad behavior.

Krampus is a half woolly faun and half human born on Earth and cursed with the inability to traverse the aurora borealis for long durations.
An unfortunate result where he has a right foot of a man covered in fur and claw like nails and the other that of a goat.
Perhaps it is his human foot that fails to carry him far along the winding sky bridge.
He has the curling horns of a ram, but a pointed nose longer than most men's.
His tongue is long and he is known for sticking it out and wagging it to mock or scare others.
His visage is often monstrous and he is certainly rumored to be vile.

In this story, **Krampus is an instigator**.
He is one of Santa's original frenzied followers who had the expectation that this pilgrimage of Santa's would result in greater power for them as individuals, and that they would dominate others in their search for newer and better lands.
Perhaps even pillage the land of the elves or share in their riches.
Either way, he'd finally overcome the weakness in his human tainted blood as a fae and escape this Earth where he is perceived as a monster.

Krampus is a misfit to the current Yuletide mission.
His old means of serving through providing negative reinforcement to children is no longer in vogue.
And the wild hunt is certainly no longer the violent bloodbath it once was where he could be the monster everyone perceives him to be and be respected for it.
Even be told he'd have a seat in Valhalla for his prowess.
With the change in how the Yuletide mission is enacted, he feels he no longer belongs and indeed has had his prior services discontinued and retroactively disparaged.

Krampus is smart, with a sharp wit, and a cruel sense of humor, befitting how the world and its people have treated him.
He encourages the revolutionists, especially towards violent acts.
He uses people's sense of honor, especially a warrior's honor, to stoke the fires in their heart.

He always calls Santa Claus "Cinder Claws" or "Cinder".
The players might not even pick up on it, which is fine, given Sinterklaus sounds similar to "Cinder Claws".
Add a passive perception check or similar if you want it known.
There is a violent event in the past where Santa earned the name "Cinder Claws" even if only called so by Krampus.
This is an event Santa now regrets and is ashamed of.
You decide what that event is and if its ever found out.

Krampus misses how it used to be and perceives the world through a harsh lens, which echoes that of a warrior.
He believes it was simpler in the past, none of this hogwash about feelings, helping the weak, or that it matters which method is used to achieve victory as long as victory is achieved.
He wants to believe he is capable and wants respect from others for his abilities.
He is a misfit to the fae, the humans, and to his trusted group who actually accepted him.
He wants to belong.

Perhaps, the [Yule Goat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yule_goat) was actually Krampus in the early beginnings, unfortunately remembered as a goat rather than a half-woolly faun.

## The Adventure Begins!

The Player Characters (PCs) are brought into the thick of it due to various circumstances, some of which we shall detail here.
Most of the PCs were summoned here by the group of elves leading the unionization effort.
The example pitch above has the players abducted as if by fairies of the [wild hunt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wild_Hunt), where they wake up to meet the hulderálfr revolutionist Beltznickle.

> GM, if you want a tight adventure that wraps up nicely in one shot, then I strongly recommend ensuring the players and their characters are all aligned to accomplish *only one goal* from the very beginning. Ensure the players and their characters know why they are here, their motivation, and have agreed upon that together.

Some alternative entrances into this adventure besides abduction by the wild hunt may include,

- The PC is a member of the Claus community, born and raised here.
    - Species-wise, hulderálfar is the most likely, although others are not impossible.
- The PC is a traveler who has heard of the fabled man in red and his mission-centric community.
    - They may seek the power or knowledge of this mortal made immortal
    - They may seek the knowledge of Yggdrasil
    - Any other reason that would motivate travel through a harsh winter wonderland to meet Santa Claus or his people.


### Adventure Checklist

Here I provide an adventure checklist following the 8 steps in [Sly Flourish's Return of the Lazy Dungeon Master](https://slyflourish.com/eight_steps_2023.html).
This is an instance of the adventure where the players are unified to help the hulderálfar unionize and save Christmas, feel free to adjust to fit your table and desires.

1. **Strong Start:**  You can Use the example hook I provided.
    - If your players prefer diplomacy before combat, this scene is ripe with multiple parties involved to inform the players of the conflict and class struggle.
        - Let them have the chance to prevent the clearly disturbed snow folk's attack by calming the emotions of the revolutionists.
        - This gathering is not only revolutionists, Twinklety is also here to provide a different perspective.
            - You decide if she knew of the abduction or not.
            - She probably not for supporting abduction, probably for seeking help from caring neighbors.
    - If your table & game want combat, such as D&D, then open with the hook and have the Snow Folk react to the violent emotions of the revolutionists and attack the everyone.
2. **Potential Scenes:** and their relevant rumors and information
    - **Awakening after abduction**:
        - Potential Combat with triggered Snow Folk.
        - Discussion with the revolutionists & unionizers on outskirts of Santa's village..
    - **Meet Krampus**: An instigating misfit who knows the old Santa well, but doesn't understand the Saint Nick.
        - Tells people of the ailing community and that the old way was the right way, where the weak became strong from the groups actions.
    - **Thieving Ice Sprites**: Ice sprites have been stealing coal and logs. Homes need heat. An opportunity for Krampusnacht-lite or full on Krampusnacht with the scares.
        - If only the delivery of new or the return of the stolen coal is done, this helps but does not deter requests as much as if scaring were to be performed.
        - If the party helps Krampus perform his Krampusnacht activities, which is scaring the spirit into people *at least*, which is against the wishes of Santa Claus, then you will decrease the amount of work necessary for the Santa community to pull off a satisfactory present delivery for Christmas
            - expectations lowered, more grateful for little things, & less requests
            - more belief, more *fear*, less love and security
    - **Meet Lil' Pete**: The able body made outcast misfit by workplace injury.
        - Resides in the misfits' igloo residence on the boundaries of Santa's village.
        - He's been taken advantage of by upper class hulderálfar.
            - Krampus would propose an in-house Krampusnacht for the uppies.
    - **The Working Class Strikes**: 10 days prior to Christmas demanding
        - more food and better living arrangements
            - More heat please!
        - less work hours and better working conditions
        - more medical support
        - The Claus family is stretched thin doing work, this strains them farther. Unable to meet demands due outside issues needing resolved to have enough resources and people to do so.
    - **Meet Mrs. Claus**: An empathetic person to those in the community. Knows Santa intimately and deeply.
        - Actively helping others, *stretched too thin* to resolve key problems alone but knows of them and can direct players to them, except does not know exactly who is the upper class people exploiting lower class.
            - When not solving management problems, she's contributes directly to the work
        - Shares rumors & hints.
    - **Seek aid of Giants**: There is a nearby coast where the giants are known to herd their woolly mammoths this time of year before going south. Request their aid.
        - Barter for resources they have on hand:
            - temporary relief: meat, fur, milk
            - Tools: mammoth ivory bones (craft material), spears & fishing rods
            - The Giants need Yetis that prey upon their herd to be removed from their path
                - The Yetis need to eat. South of the mountains they may find more food, but that is asking them to relocate and spare the woolly mammoth meal already here. They will require some form of convincing.
        - Provide a path open southwards to more resource plentiful lands
            - They provide a path by trimming small branches or twigs from the world tree that can serve to fashion sleighs and similar items to traverse the aurora borealis when navigated by fae.
    - **Fishery Poaching**: Yetis have started hunting in the Santa Village's fisheries.
        - Also, every now and then polar bears take from the fisheries, which is why the yetis thought it was okay to do, but now they over do it alone.
            - Can also handle polar bears, if desired, but they take less than the yetis.
        - Yetis can hunt elsewhere, but is farther than they want to go.
    - **The Snow Folk Rage**: On the outskirts of town and at coastal farms
        - They rage in part due to how those on the outskirts feel. The more the outskirts' quality of life improves the more they are willing to calm down.
        - The lower class manage coastal kelp farms and coastal fisheries in the cold near the outskirts.
        - An ice floe needed broken as it was heading for their farms. Its shattering disturbed the snow folk residing within.
        - If the middle class had time (overworked) or the upper class listened, it could have been towed out of the way in time.
    - **Meet Santa Claus**: Open to discuss problems and potential solutions.
        - After certain problems above are resolved, Santa can afford to meet the trade union's demands, thus helping to quell the revolution.
        - *Strongly opposed to fear and violence*
        - However, he will do *whatever* is necessary to ensure at least a bare minimum Christmas this year.
    - **Stop (or join) the Revolution**
3. **Secrets & Clues:**
    - The lower class and misfits live in the outskirts of Santa village. Out of sight, out of mind.
    - Krampus and Cinder Klaus: Krampus knows well Santa's darker past while the others old enough to know seem to willfully ignore it or say them in the softest of whispers behind closed doors.
    - The upper hulderálfar hold an extravagant ball that is invite only. All the festivities will be available.
    - Any of the above potential scenes serve as rumors as well. We couple some of them with their underlying causes or notable effects
        - Cause: supply lines are strained in part due to Fishery Poaching and Raging Snow Folk
            - Effect: Food shortage
        - Effect: Lack of crafting resources
            - Main Cause: Lower + Middle overworked, thus are unable to go out and acquire resources
            - Cause: People are leaving
                - Cause: Lower + Middle overworked, exploitation / improper management
            - Cause: Supply lines are strained from Raging Snow Folk.
                - Cause: Lower + Middle overworked, exploitation / improper management
        - Effect: Lack of health care and medicine
            - Cause: not prioritized enough by management: exploitation / improper management
            - Cause: Lack of funds. Must trade goods and services with outsiders.
4. **Fantastic Locations:**
    - **Santa's Village**: Less of a village and more of a mobile fleet of icebreaker ships. An array of wooden [icebreaker ships](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Icebreaker) reinforced with metal float amongst the drift ice. They are connected to each other by floating planks of wood and from them emanates a cold magic that pulls in the heat from the surrounding water. This forms ice around them and provides internal heat within the boats.
        - *Lower class*: Outskirts lower class: igloos upon stable snow covered ice floes just outside the village's outer boats
            - **Lil' Pete's Igloo**: A small and recently built igloo with one ice block window and a couple of furs laid down inside. A small hulderálfr sits sniffling, bundled up in a fur cradling a broken arm.
            - **Krampus' Igloo**: A well established igloo with a large interior covered in matted furs. Things be strewn about, but not in the way of the main bed and passageway. His igloo features a longer entry tunnel that stores his various belongings.
        - *Middle class*: In the village, but outer ring. Nicely decorated. Some get to have boat rooms.
            - for some igloos, they may enter the boats interior or smaller dingies
        - *Upper class*: In middle of the village in extravagantly decorated houses next to the key workshops and offices, which are built upon two large icebreaker ships closely docked on either side of one larger ship. They too form ice floes upon the water's surface with similar magic.
            - **Santa's Workshop**: and office where large nutcracker golems stand on either side of the entrance. Wooden poles painted in swirling stripes of red, white, and green hold up similarly colored flags that blow in the wind above the door.
    - **Giant's Pasture**: Large mountains line this coast where a winding trail goes up and between two sharp peaks. Various grasses and vegetation available that the mammoths would graze upon.
    - **An Iceberg Cavern** : Home to the yetis or the ice sprites, this is a blue green ice cavern that floats away from the coast and Santa's village.
    - **The Branching Aurora Borealis Bridge** : Whether on sleigh or by fae magic, the aurora borealis is able to be traversed as if walking within large branches of light.
        These are reached by flight or high altitude points, such as mountains, although with enough fae magic the right incantations, one can ascend upon fae-blessed wood or materials that originate from Yggdrasil.
5. **Monsters:** Adjust as you see fit and to your PC's party level
    - 1d4 + 3 ice sprites
    - 1d2 + 2 yetis per group (Mountain group + fishery poaching group)
    - 1d2 polar bears
    - 1d4 + 1 frost giants
        - 1d6 + 6 Mammoths
    - 1d4 + 4 Wooden golems painted and constructed as large nutcrackers
6. **Nonplayer Characters:** And some with modern media characters to inform their archetype
    - Santa Claus, a male human turned immortal
    - Freya (Mrs. Claus), an elven woman
        - Lagertha from 2013 TV series Vikings
    - Krampus, a male woolly faun
        - The Grinch + Jinx from Arcane.
    - Lil' Pete, a male hulderálfr
    - Twinklety, a young, optimistic female hulderálfr
        - She seeks to unionize the hulderálfar & works.
    - Revolutionist Beltznickle, a gruff male hulderálfr
        - He is the one who speaks to the player's in the example hook.
        - While also having partook in the scaring of naughty children, Beltznickle also prefers this new direction, but he cannot stand the exploitation of the middle and lower class hulderálfar. He particularly wants to see the fat trimmed from the upper class and better awareness, consideration, and action from the Claus family.
    - Gróa, a female Giant mammoth herder and tender to the world tree
        - A wise and patient woman whose witnessed many seasons, but is nonetheless fit and fierce. If the frost giants truly have boiling blood, then she's mastered her meditations and control of it. For this and her wisdom, she is well respected by her fellow giants as well as neighboring townsfolk.
    - Kólga, a female troll pack leader. Hot headed, harsh, and hungry. Not unreasonable, but very aware of what the laws of nature allow and not, to put it simply. With her "survival of the fittest" and "might makes right" attitude, she still can respect her neighbors if they respect her... from a distance.
7. **Magic Items:** Only a few here. Tailor to your players.
    - A top of ceaseless spinning: Spins until grabbed or bumped enough
    - Everice Shard: said to come from beyond the Bifröst. Used within each icebreaker that forms ice in its surrounding waters
    - Eternal Cinder: A rare everburning cinder said to have been the remains of burning trimmings of Yggdrasil.
        - A boon in these frozen lands
    - Yule Logs : May be any log dedicated to the Yuletide burning, but ideally carved with yuletide markings and more so ideally from the trimmings of the Yggdrasil.
        - Burning lasts longer and can survive in strong winds and winter storms where typical logs would be put out. May be used to make a torch.
        - Perhaps the Yuletide carved markings keep away mischievous fae looking to steal warmth? Perhaps, it provides them with their own heat without depriving the owner of the log of theirs.
8. **Review Your Notes Before the Game**

### Potential Outcomes

There is always more than one way to solve a problem.
Some may be different in method, but result in a similar outcome.
Perhaps, it is not only the outcome that matters, but also how we solve the problem?
Nonetheless, there are several potential outcomes for this class struggle which will ultimately be determined by the players' actions.
This is a non-exhaustive list for ideas.

- The Elves **Unite**: The vast majority come together for a singular cause
    - The Elves **Unionize**: The first Christmas Elf Trade Union is formed!
    - The Elves **Revolt**: The first Christmas Elf Revolution begins!
        - The Elves **Usurp**:
        - The Elves **Lose**:
            - The Elves who **Perish**:
            - The Elves who **Desert**:
            - The Elves who are **Exiled**:
            - The Elves who **Surrender**:
    - The Elves **Submit**:
    - The Elves **Leave**:
- The Elves **Shattered**: Unable to unite, the elves are disorganized. Any subfaction formed is weaker than if they successfully united.
Some drastic actions of a few can still impact the many, but the elves are in disarray.
Fortunately, the Claus family cares about them, and so their conditions will eventually improve, but at what cost and when? Or will the Claus family be stretched too thin and this whole operation collapse?

## Conclusion

This took longer and resulted in a longer post than I expected.
I don't intend this kind of length to be what I typically write and instead it may have been better to break this apart into multiple blog posts, however the ideas didn't really come together until the end.
I think some more refinement could be made here especially in navigating the nuance of the classist struggle.
In my unpublished notes I marked down some thoughts on how each key class would fit on Maslow's hierarchy of needs (scientific validity set aside), where its more about given those types of needs and how satisfied they are on a scale of 1-5 and how much energy would it take someone in that class to further satisfy that need on their own given available resources.
But alas, I am out of time and this is quite long already.
This isn't even considering various things I've learned like that icebergs that flip over in the ocean could apparently have as much energy as a small atomic nuke.
If Santa's workshop was on a floating iceberg, flipping it would be one crazy destructive ending!
