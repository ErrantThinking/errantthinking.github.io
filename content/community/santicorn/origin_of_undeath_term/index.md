As part of my
[Secret Santicorn present](@/community/santicorn/origin_of_undeath/index.md) for "500poundsofnothing", I researched the concept of undeath where I encountered a claim that "undead" as a term that we recognize today is rather recent as of 1897 from Bram Stoker's "Dracula".
I'm sharing what I found.
While incomplete, I still find it interesting to consider the use of "undead" as we think of it today.

## History

I encountered a surprising statement that Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula" is responsible for establishing the term of the "undead" for our modern common concept.
However this seemed to be unverified without a proper citation on Wikipedia, so I decided to take a bit of look out of curiosity, although I was unable to provide a more definitive answer.
Another unverified statement and even more surprising claim is that Bram Stoker considered naming the famous novel "The Undead".
What is believable is that prior to "Dracula", the term "undead" meant "alive" or "not dead" instead of our common concept of "to be alive after death" especially with regards to the mortal coil's expiration.

Below is Google Books Ngram Viewer of works from 1500s-2022 for "undead","undeath", "un-dead", vampire, vampyre, and zombie.
For each keyword, this shows their percentage of occurrence among other words.

From the 1980s onwards, the use of some of these terms dramatically increased, which makes it hard to see the variance of the prior years at this scale.
If we zoom in on the range 1500-1980, we can better observe the fluctuations.

width=750rem height=270

Isolating just "undead", "undeath", and "un-dead" (how Bram Stoker would sometimes write it) within 1500-1980 we can better see their relative use.

From this we can see some use of "undeath", "undead", and even "un-dead" prior to Bram Stoker although he certainly initiates a peak at 1897.
These only show word use without providing the exact sources, so I'll leave this tangent here for now.

I am curious what text Google is using for ~1580 spike in "undeath" and ~1640 for "undead".
And the early 1600s use of "vampire" too.


While the term for the concept is most firmly established in 1897, the idea of undeath greatly predates "Dracula".
This is to be expected with all the folklore across history including the concepts of the afterlife and accounts of resurrection or ghosts, [revenants](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revenant) (Old French for "returning") and much more.
"Dracula" itself is inspired by the folktales that detail creatures similar to the vampire.

- The **strigoi** of Romanian mythology and
- the **nosferatu**, an archaic Romanian word whose etymology is not fully understood.
Some of my favorite hypotheses being "nosferatu" is derived from "nesuferit" for "unbearable" or "insufferable", which is a great insult to drop on that big bad vampire in your next game.
- [Dhampir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhampir). An interesting dramatic setup in their folklore is they are able to see the invisible creature that was one of their parents.
- [Kallikantzaros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kallikantzaros) are busy sawing down the giant tree that supports the earth, but they come out from December 25 to January 6th as part of the twelve days of Christmas to cause some mischief.
    - That's new folklore creature for me and was unexpected as it connected vampires. They suck the blood from the Christmas roast apparently and also in part from the hypothesized etymology.
- [Vrykolakas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vrykolakas) Greek undead demon.

Worth noting some vampire precurssors in literature.
These explain some of the rise in the terms "vampire" and "vampyre" around 1800s before Bram Stoker in the above chart.
- [The Vampyre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Vampyre) 1819 by Joyhn William Polidori taken by Lord Byron's story. This was a story telling contest that also spawned "Frankenstein" by Mary Shelley.
- [Carmilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carmilla) 1872 Gothic novella by Irish author Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu.
