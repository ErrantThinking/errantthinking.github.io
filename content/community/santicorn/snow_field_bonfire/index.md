It's [Christmas in July](@/community/santicorn/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md) and I'm delivering a missing present to [The Byzantine](https://espharel.blogspot.com/) from Secret Santicorn 2024.

## 1d6 Strange Encounters of Wandering Souls Seeking Warmth

The visitors will stay awhile, especially those peaceful travelers seeking warmth and company.
If they stick around long enough, the party may double up on visitors!
You cannot have two Granny Jams at the same time, but perhaps one of her friends, family, or business partners happens by.
The Twelve Watches of Santicorn only adds more of the types of visitors, never doubles a current type of visitor beyond their set amount.

### 1. Lone Animal

A lone animal emerges from the snow field.
It seems cold and hungry, but does not look eager to fight.
If not prevented, will curl by the fire for warmth.
Stays longer if given food and good company.

1. A Lone Wolf
2. A Lone Moose
3. A Lone Grizzly Bear
5. A Lone Arctic Fox
4. A Lone Penguin
6. A Lone Santicorn

### 2. Ice Fairies

**2d4** Ice fairies have emerged from the snow field.
They've come to steal away your warmth!
The ice fairies are tricksters who extinguish fires by stealing its heat and embers.

### 3. A Hulking Cloaked Figure

A hulking cloaked figure emerges from the snow fields!
This guy is *huge!*
The creature slowly walks towards the flame.
What do the players do?
If let join the fire, it will sit on a log or chair and take up a lot of space, but is otherwise not very talkative beyond grumbles and is peaceful.
If not attacked it will grumble and leave a reward for the players before it departs.

1. Ulga, a boreal forest lumberjack.
2. A lycanthrope who remembered to take their potion and is not only of sound mind, but also is friendly, albeit cautious to not scare anyone. They await for their transformation to end, ideally not in the freezing cold.
3. A frosty ghoul, seeking warmth and camaraderie in their undeath.
4. Albert, a malformed man from experimentation gone wrong.

Why are they here? Why aren't they elsewhere?

### 4. Cold Elementals

Based on the cold elementals in [Oh no, it's snow!](@/community/santicorn/oh_no_its_snow/index.md), roll **1d4** to determine the total elementals.
For each 4 rolled, roll again, summing the result.
Then roll a **1d4** per elemental to find which one it is.
The elementals love the cold and are here to extinguish the fire!

Perhaps the party accidentally setup their bonfire over or near a cold elemental.

### 5. Granny Jam

[Granny Jam](@/granny_jam/index.md) emerges from the snow field!
She brings with her multiple wears of jams and jellies and more!
She will sell her goods to the players if interested, and if she is treated well and the players earn her favor, then they will get some special jam for free.

### 6. The Twelve Watches of Santicorn

I had to callback to the classic song here as not much is more strange than encountering any of the twelve day's bringings.
This is a repeatable event per watch, and each time you roll a **1d12** and record what chance encounter has occurred.
The next time you roll an encounter from this **1d12** table, the past item is excluded from the table results, meaning you either reroll if you get it again or decrease the list to the unencountered and roll a more appropriate die for that size.
Whatever new encounter you get from the remaining results is accompanied by all of your past encounters from this table as well, just like how the song is sung, but with more chaos.

1. a partridge in a pear tree
2. two turtle doves
3. three french hens
4. four calling birds
5. five gold rings
6. six geese a-laying
7. seven swans a-swimming
8. eight maids a-milking
9. nine ladies dancing
10. ten lords a-leaping
11. eleven pipers piping
12. twelve drummers drumming

All of these creatures are intelligent enough to attempt their shared goal of finding one another and heading out together where they need to go.
Those that can be communicated with would indeed communicate this with the party.
If they all manage to meet, they will play a tune and the lone Santicorn will appear, summoned by their jovial tune and holiday spirit.
