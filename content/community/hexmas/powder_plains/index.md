As part of [Prismatic Wasteland's Rankin/Bass-themed 2025 Merry Hexmas](@/community/hexmas/hexmas_2025/index.md), I've contributed the Powder Plains as a snowfield hex.
A relatively peaceful snowfield featuring multiple towns including Snowville, a village of cold elementals which neighbors the Snow Henge.

## Terrain and Biome

A few towns are spread across the plains of this dry tundra.
The snow forms dunes and is powdery.
Great for skiing.
When the humidity from the southwest blows in the powder plains, the snow becomes more moist and is then better suited for building snowmen and snow forts!

### Weather of Powder Plains

Cold and always snow covered.

1. Clear skies
    - If daytime, snow blindness can occur
2. Light clouds, no snow
3. Light snow, what snow?
4. Light snow, oh so fluffy
5. Heavy fluffy snow
6. White-out Blizzard

Blizzards are dangerous in the Powder Plains. If you are caught in one while travelling here, you are unlikely to find shelter unless you're in the towns.
Typically, this means you have to dig into the snow and form a temporary shelter this way.
To brave the blizzard in the powder plains is to take it straight on, as there is nothing to block the harsh winds on any side!
If you're fortunate enough to be in a town, the people will shelter you in their homes.

## Rumors of the Powder Plains

The rumors for each location are within their respective section.

## Random Encounters

If you setup a camp outside of the villages, especially if you setup a bonfire, roll on [A Snow Field Bonfire](@/community/santicorn/snow_field_bonfire/index.md) for encounters.

### Roaming Characters from the Powder Plains

- [Cold-based Elementals](@/community/santicorn/oh_no_its_snow/index.md)
    - **Sam the Snowman**: A town-to-town travelling bard.
    - **Frosty the Snowman** and his family
        - Frosty's wife **Crystal**
        - Frosty's son **Chilly**
        - Frosty's daughter **Milly**
- **Keh Nights** diesel punk automata (attempt to) roam the areas of this hex and its neighbors, lost, and attempting to serve a purpose now long gone.
    - Some frozen Keh Night scouts are found by chance. Froze as they attempted to fulfill their long futile directives.
    - These are smoky coal or other combustion powered automata.
    - Crude, inelegant, however they can get the job done.
    - The ruins of Kubla Kraus' castle are *not* in the Powder Plains.
    - Some Keh Nights have *Two Faces* instead of one. These ones move more purposefully, and even command other Keh Nights with new directives
        - More graceful. More purposeful.
        - Seem more like marionettes puppeteered by shadows and smoke plumes
        - Few may even seem sentient
        - Rumor: *Heart of Darkness*: A darkness beneath the stolen heart spreads out to fill not only its void, but all the lands. It's reach is subtle, but the Powder Plains are within its grasp.

## Locations within the Powder Plains

While January Junction from Rankin/Bass 1979 "Jack Frost" is nestled within the Powder Plains,
the ruins of Kubla Kraus' castle are *not* in the Powder Plains.

### January Junction

Near the center of the Powder Plains is a poor human town whose folklore celebrate the beginnings and the ending of things. They celebrate the liminality of life's journey.
- History: suffered from subjugation by the King Kubla Kraus.
- Snip's Tailor Shop is well known in the North Pole.
- Other features, basic town amenities, taverns, inns, library, guardsmen, fishermen, hunters, miners.
- The crestfallen **Sir Raveneau**, a widower
    - A renowned Gold Knight hails from this town, said to have served King Arthur!
    - In his midlife, past his youthful vibrancy, but still surprisingly vigorous, that is if his spirit wasn't broken.
    - Lost his wife, Elisa, to a monster attack.
    - In a rut, though if you or the Cult of Janus get to him, he could be up and swinging that sword in no time! ...But at who?
- A *twisted* Cult of Janus
    - **Sady Mason**: One of the villagers with their head on right.  Takes care of others. Sees the world clearly for what it is and make plans to help the town and people. However sound her logic seems, she has a twisted perspective due to her past experiences.
        - Devoted demon worshiper or otherwise has some dark twist to emphasize 2 faces.

#### Dominic Subter

**Dominic Subter** is a seedy, slimey fellow, He has quests for adventures that pay handsomely.
    - Think Grima Wormtongue from "The Lord of the Rings".
    - Will steer people towards the glory of Janus, to end their old ways that fetter them down, and open them to new beginnings.  A beginning where they no longer need to fear the dark. A promising pitch in a world where there are very real horrors in neighboring hexes!

Dominic is always looking for help, which he will pay for handsomely!
Most of these are delivery jobs that are not easy given the natural barriers between the Powder Plains and other settlements.
Dominic's job board and flyers include:
- **Retrieve** a lost delivery of **black & red candy cane** from [the Seven Levels of the Candy Cane Forest](https://muto2525.substack.com/p/the-seven-levels-of-the-candy-cane).
    - After Dominic has this candy cane, new deliveries from this supply become available options
        - **Deliver** some to the [Talking Wishing Well](https://www.prismaticwasteland.com/blog/castle-claus-the-keep-on-the-north-pole#block-yui_3_17_2_1_1766360477277_21423) by throwing it down the well.
        - **Deliver** some to Sir Raveneau if he is not currently a fallen paladin.
        - **Deliver** some to the Yule Barbarians.
- **Deliver** a package of **oil, grease, and coal** to *Borsk* for the [Baboon salesperson](https://coppershaman.com/merry-hexmas-babbling-baboon/).
    - **Retrieve** a package of Baboon toys from the salesman.
- **Deliver** a wax sealed letter to **Timbok** at the [Orcish Toy Factory](https://magnoliakeep.blogspot.com/2025/11/blog-bandwagon-orcish-toy-factory.html)
    - If opened, the letter is incredibly difficult to reseal without leaving evidence of tampering. But where there is a will... there is a way!
    - If read, the letter details another nearby volcano, Mount Heart in the Sleeping Slopes, that the Orcs may migrate to and use as a new Genesis Pit to bear copious new orcs and earn their independence. The letter details a "Pulmonary Pass", which has a secret entrance in the westward valleys of the Sleeping Slopes that leads into the Left Atrium that lies beneath Mount Heart.


#### Sir Raveneau

The crestfallen once-a-knight now widower wallows in his grief of losing his beloved Elisa.
He tends to be shut in his home buried in his grief.
The locals know of this, and express concern for the once-renowned gold knight.
They fear the darkness of the mountain may corrupt him too.

If the adventurers are unable to help Sir Raveneau return to daily life after learning about him, then given a few days the twisted cult of Janus will indoctrinate Sir Raveneau and bring a close to his now diminished golden years and bring rise to his dark era as a **fallen paladin**.
Sir Raveneau the Dark Knight terrorizes travelers in the Powder Plains and performs the dark deeds of the twisted cult of Janus.


### Snowdin

Towards the northeast border of the Powder Plains, a small and peaceful monster settlement sits between the streams that drain from the Sleeping Slopes.
The monster residents have a prominent folkoric history of settling down and founding the town after being freed from a dreadful underworld. Upon being freed, they learned what it meant to be misfits in this world.
- Yes, this is an [Undertale reference](https://undertale.fandom.com/wiki/Snowdin)
- Bunny People, Dinosaur people, Fish people, Dogs, Dog/wolf people, Venus Man Eating Trap monsters (think Little Shop of Horrors), skeletons (yeah the source of em is an open question they don't know the answer to either)
    - Simply take the cast from Undertale's Snowdin if you need characters or monster ideas.
- Known for an _incredible local bakery_, one of their specialties being powedered doughnuts.
    - run by **Arachne**, a female monstrous spider with a humanoid torso, head, and two human arms among her other 6 spider arms. Her human face has eight spider eyes instead of human and notably sharp and curved fangs.
    - A shrewd, yet charismatic business woman
        - "Honey catches more flies than vinegar."
    - Some of her special treats are able to provide foresight
    - Can perform a divination at a cost
    - Likes tea, crumpets, and all baked goods
    - Has a daughter named Muffet
- Features a "Snowed Inn", a general store, a library, "Grillby's" diner, several houses, a town center with a Christmas tree, and a nearby lake filled by the Sleeping Slopes that drains into a stream that flows southwest into the Vorpal Vale.
    - **Grillby** is a Fire Elemental in humanoid form.
    - The general store sells polarized sunglasses, which help against snow blindness.

#### Secret Exit from Mineralis

The lore of the original monsters who fled the depths beneath the **Sleeping Slopes** speaks of a once sealed barrier wall that was opened from within and allowed them to leave the mountains and found Snowdin.
This secret exit from the underground beneath Mount Heart could be used again as a secret entrance if it could be located from the sacred history the monsters maintain across written scrolls and oral traditions.
If located and able to be opened from the outside, then this would lead into the Left Atrium of the Heart Chambers underneath Mount Heart in the Sleeping Slopes.

### Snowville

Nearby to the Snow Henge is a village featuring entirely [Cold Elementals](@/community/santicorn/oh_no_its_snow/index.md).
- Perhaps Sam the Snowman has family or friends here?
- Frosty the Snowman & family settled down in Snowville
- Note that these Cold Elementals are influenced by the local emotions of living beings. If the people are afraid, then the elementals are too and will become frightening and territorial to ward off danger.
    - Fight, Flight, _Freeze_
    - They are physical manifestations of the spirit of the locals. The good, the bad, the ugly.
- Offers the best snow cones and shaved ice you've ever had!
- **Rumors**
    - There is a terrible rumor of a *Tooth Fairy* who's victims are forced to have all their teeth yanked from their jaw.
        - Fortunately, no one in Snowdin had an encounter with this tooth fairy _yet_.
    - "The Dark Year" is hunting for "Happy" New Year. The babe's gone missing. His twisted clockwork horrors hunt tirelessly, without rest.

### Snow Henge

A circular dip is surrounded by multiple rings formed by carved stones stacked atop each other.
Some form archways, others form thick rising pillars.
All have runes and different humanoid or animal features carved into and out of them.
- Snow, _the_ [Snow Elemental](@/community/santicorn/oh_no_its_snow/index.md)
- New snow elementals emerge from this henge, although it is unknown how or why
- Those who desecrate the henge face the wrath of Snow & his people.
- A graveyard exists on one side of the henge where people who either worshipped or felt close with the nature of these elementals chose to reside for eternity
- The henge with proper resources and a well executed ritual could create an "Heart of Ice", which is a brilliant-gemstone-cut pseudo-Everice the size of a basketball.
    - _Everice_ is ice taken from the *Bifrost* and is inherently magical, useful as a medium for ice spells. Only those who traverse the Bifrost or walk the branches of Yggdrasil can access the Everice for harvesting.
    - This "Heart of Ice" is not as strong as a true "Heart of Everice".
    - Dependent upon the emotional state of those at the time of creation.
    - The Heart of Ice or Heart of Everice both can serve as the [Ice Crystal for the Tiny Bronco](https://www.fluoriteguillotine.com/blog/2025/11/08/blogwagon-broken-bronco-on-the-silver-steppe)

### Snow Barrows

Towards the southeast border of the Powder Plains, the Snow Barrows solemnly lie.
Originally started as a large single bell barrow of a tundra chief and his family with his warriors and servants in a long barrows that form rings around the chief's barrow.
The barrows have grown over the ages to include long barrows as broken circular arcs that surround the original ring barrow.
Every barrow has at least one entry passage and an interior room.
It is a place where kids often test their bravery to sled down the barrows sides.


### Locations Along the Way

The above were distinct locations with set positions within the Powder Plains.
These are things you'll find along the way in between the others.

- igloo
- snowed in cabin
- trampled snow path
