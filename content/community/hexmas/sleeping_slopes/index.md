A jagged mountain range that features a long dormant volcano, Mount Heart, with a frozen spire at its top. The hollowed out volcano that was once mined for its riches and resources is now abandoned. Perhaps due to the dark secrets within its depths?

This is inspired by the Mines of Moria from "The Lord of the Rings" as well as
the Rankin/Bass films "The Hobbit", "Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King",
"Jack Frost", and
"Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July".
Extra inspiration comes from Disney's movie Frozen and the 1844 "The Snow Queen" by Hans Christian Andersen.

## Terrain and Biome

Mountainous tundra

### Weather of the Slumbering Slopes

Cold, frigid, and snowy are the norms!
Even worse now with Frenzied Frost raging all around in a whirlwind.

Due to the dense mountain range, their perilous mountain paths, and frigid weather, it takes **x3 the typical time** to traverse this hex.

## Rumors of the Sleeping Slopes

You are imminent danger when travelling the Slumbering Slopes!
In addition to the harsh cold, expect to face dangerous creatures and spirits.

The volcano, Mount Heart, was once active long ago, but there is a tale of how someone once stole the volcanoes heart and since then it has been inactive.

The volcano has been hollowed out and mined deep into the Earth to harvest its resources.
A mining fortress city was constructed within the volcano and its ruinous remains still dwell within.
It is said the miners dug too deep and uncovered a **deep darkness** that began its ascent.
The inhabitants had to flee, leaving the volcano and the mines still in their slumber.

Orcs were said to have infested the mines and frequent their shadowy halls.

That is within the volcano, but above is something else.
A frozen spire cuts the frigid sky above the volcano.
The spire certainly connects to the mined out volcano below, but entry into the spire from below is blocked.
Only entry is within the cold outside where sentries guard its gates, said to be able to see any warmth and snuff it out.

Both Snow Miser and Heat Miser desire the Volcano and Spire.
- Snow Miser loves the spire and sees it as a wonderful ice palace he'd love to own.
It also serves as a mark of mastery over the snuffed out flames of the volcano.
- Heat miser wants to awaken the volcano and burn down the spire in its eruption.
To have an active volcano in the North would be a grand strategic positioning and point of pride for him in his war against his brother.

Many creatures of the sleeping slopes have **thermal vision** as it helps them hunt and snuff out undesirable flames.

It is said that the secrets of the demise of the North Pole King of yore, Winterbolt.
