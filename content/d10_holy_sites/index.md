To kick of this December, I have decided to deliver a missing present to [Mothman
](https://explodecorpse.blogspot.com) from [Secret Santicorn 2024](@/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md).

## The Prompt

> D10 Holy sites to take pilgrimages to, the dangers that might surround them and the blessings they give. Extra credit if you make a seasonal holiday (not necessarily winter) for each one.
