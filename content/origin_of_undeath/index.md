Another year, another December, another [Secret Santicorn](@/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md) present delivered.
This time I deliver the present of "The Origin of Undeath" to [500poundsofnothing](http://evilgoblin.wedding/).

## Prompt
 > The origin of undeath.

I've split this into two posts.
One for [some initial research](@/origin_of_undeath_term/index.md) I did on the origins of undeath as a term.
And here, the main post including
a short story and a couple of initial ideas for "classes" and their abilities pertaining to the type of undeath featured in the story.

## The Tale of Poeh & the Wounded Knight

The tale of life is many. Of death, singular.
But of undeath? What of undeath?
The wretched undead, as I'm sure you've heard, are quite plentiful and various.
However, I can tell you of one said to be the heart of many.
Let me tell you the tale of undeath's beginnings.

*Ad vitam aeternam.*

Once upon a time, where the sands of eternity have since drifted far beyond, there was a small church.
In this church dwelled a priest named Poeh.
He worshiped his goddess faithfully and served as his town's local healer.
Poeh was a pacifist, a meek young man dedicated to his Lady and whose heart wept for those in need.
He'd tend to the sick, the wounded, and the downtrodden regardless of any colors they flew.
Alas, this would be his doom.

*Aqua vitae.*

The lord who ruled the sands at this time, the Verdant Man, was delusional with grandeur that his supreme reign would bring about an oasis this place has never seen before.
He would visit Poeh frequently seeking the blessing of the goddess of mercy.
Yet he commanded his people to squeeze water from the stones and in doing so only draw blood.
In need of more workers to change this land into a paradise, he sought war with his neighbors.
Poeh would pray that the Lady's mercy find him.

*Arare litus.*

One day full of the sun's bright rays burning down upon the sands and through the windows, a woman arrived, armor clad, and terribly wounded.
These sands knew well the taste of blood from countless wars and this one was simply another fresh drink unless something could be done to stop her bleeding.
She wore a tunic of blue hues while in a land that flew green, yet she sought sanctuary in their church, for the goddess and her mercy is honored by all.
She stumbled past the pews to the altar with a blade in one hand as her other hand clutched her side, soaked in bright red blood.

*Memento mori.*

A sword clatters upon the ground.
Knees strike stone.
Blood is drawn.
Feet strike stone steps in a rush.
Grasping the gasping.
Wrapping unravelling flesh.
Uttering prayers regardless of prey or predator.

*Dum vita est, spest est.*

Poeh channeled all of his and his Ladys' mercy into the bleeding knight.
The wound bandaged with ointments on hand, but he knew it would not be enough.
Metal clanged from beyond the sanctuaries walls.
Poeh rushed to his still room.
He grabbed his shepherd's purse and the yarrow,
cut the Eryngium,
and split the mugwort.
Half for the blood, half to burn.
Ground it to dust in a rush,
he replaced the newly soaked banages.
With mugwort aflame and iron hot, flesh was sealed.
Newly anointed and swathed,
the red rivers dammed.
But the knight's life has drained upon the floor.

*Aut viam inveniam aut faciam.*

No honorable knight would die under Poeh's care.
The stones soaked red, Poeh drew runes as his incantations drowned out the raucous outside world.
The runes flowed from his goddess to him and from him to the knight.
Rubbing his prayer beads to splinters between his hands, he drew his own blood.
It flowed through his crafted channel towards the knight and
to him flowed the goddesses' divine presence... or so he hoped.

*Ad vitam aut culpam.*

The world silent.
The knight breathed.
Poeh left gasping.
The Verdant Man behind him bore witness, unheard.
One final *clang*.
The last stroke of red.


The new born purple knight, she clasped her sword.
The Verdant man's face turned pale,
his veins drained.
In the end, the sand's thirst was quenched.

*Amor fati.*


## Vitamancer

A Vitamancer is someone who mastered the art of manipulating life magic.
Vitamancers are closely related to necromancers, yet they stand in sharp contrast in that their art is about manipulating the life force of living creatures, possibly putting that life force elsewhere, rather than capturing the lost souls of the dead or reanimating their corpses through unnatural means.
This means they can control the flow of life and redirect the vital essence to accumulate where the wish, while limited by the law of conservation.

They can use their own life essence as a source of power, which needs proper recovery or could prove fatal.

### Spells

#### "ad vitam aut culpam" : "for life or until fault"

A gamble of one's own life with the power of the goddess.
As long as the caster does not take damage, they are blessed and benefit from advantage.
The cost to cast is a set pool of life force put up as stakes.at the beginning.
Which is lost upon being hit, but regained if  not hit.

#### "apologia pro vita sua" : "defense of one's life",

You can manipulate and reposition your life force to form a stronger defense in one area or aspect of your defenses. This can manifest physically as a shield, at the cost of general life force. Or this could bolster one's mental defenses at a cost of their mental processing and headaches or light-headedness.

#### "aqua vitae" : "water of life"

Typically refers to the spirit of wine referring to native distilled beverages.
Here, as part of one's preparations for the day and after being well rested, a Vitamancer can allocate a part of their vital essence into a vial for use as a Healing Potion later by another or themself.

#### "memento mori" : "remember you must die"

An offensive spell that takes one's life force to be redirected into something or someone else. A decent default destination being the caster.

#### "ars longa, vita brevis" : "art is long, life is short"
Bless someone's performance at their craft to a degree coupled with the amount of life sacrificed.

#### Where there's will there's a way
Relevant Latin phrases:
- dum spiro spero, "while I breathe, I hope"
- dum vita est, spest est, "while there is life, there is hope"

Sacrifice one's own vitality or will for an improvement (advantage) in the odds of a favorable outcome.

#### "ad vitam aeternam": "to eternal life", "to life everlasting"

A sacred art of only the wisest and most experienced Vitamancers after a long, probably extended life.
This spell is more so a way of life and results in a form of immortality for the Vitamancer.

This is equivalent to a "Level 20 ability" or other kind of end-game abilities.

#### "ad multos annos", "to many years",

A simpler form or "ad vitam aeternam" that is accessible as a ritual with a significant resource cost available to a journeyman or expert Vitamancer.


## Bone Caller

A type of necromancer or vitamancer who specialized in bones and skeletons.
It is rumored that Poeh became the first living skeleton.

### Spells

- "sero venientibus ossa", "Those who are late get bones"
- "tarde venientibus ossa", "To the late are left the bones"

I'd make this a literal timing challenge using something like the stopwatch challenges from [Dreaming Dragonslayer](https://dreamingdragonslayer.wordpress.com/2021/04/25/stopwatch-dueling-game-duels-vs-npcs/).
The loser gets hit by some pile of bones.

Some other spell ideas:
- Bone Bolt: shoot a bone like a crossbow bolt
- Wall of Bones: Conjure bones to erupt from the ground forming a wall

## Blood Arts

A Vitamancer that specializes in blood as the medium of the life force that they manipulate.
They're magic is limited to only blood effects, however due to their focus on that medium, they are able to better use such blood based spells than a typical Vitamancer.

A normal Vitamancer can also harness the soul or spirit of living creatures and other parts of living creatures than just blood.

Some other spell ideas, although beware the cost of resources!
- Blood Bolt: shoot a bolt of blood like a crossbow bolt
- Wall of Blood: As wall of water, but blood. An extra source, say livestock blood is recommended.
