## History

It may surprise you that Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula" is responsible for establishing our modern common concept of  "undead".
Perhaps even more surprising is that Bram Stoker considered naming the famous novel "The Undead".
Prior to "Dracula", the term "undead" meant "alive" or "not dead" instead of our common concept of "to be alive after death" especially with regards to the mortal coil's expiration.

While the term for the concept is most firmly established in 1897, the idea of undeath greatly predates "Dracula".
"Dracula" itself is inspired by the folktales that detail creatures similar to the vampire.

The **strigoi** of Romanian mythology and the **nosferatu**, an archaic Romanian word.


## The Origin of Undeath

The tale of life is many, of death; singular.
But of undeath? What of undeath?
The wretched undeath, as I'm sure you've heard, is quite plentiful and various.
However it begun from naught but one.
Let me tell you the tale of undeath's beginnings.

Once upon a time, where the sands of time have since drifted far beyond for a millennia, there once a small church.
In this church dwelled a priest, Poeh, who served his goddess faihfully and served as his town's local healer.
Poeh was a pacifist, a meek young man dedicated to his goddess and whose heart weeped for those in need.
He'd tend to the sick, the wounded, and the downtrodden regardless of any colors they flew.
Alas, this would be his doom.

One day full of the sun's bright rays burning down upon the sands and through the windows, a woman arrived, armor clad, and terribly wounded.
These sands knew well the taste of blood from countless wars and this one was simply another fresh drink.
She wore a tunic of blue hues of the invading army, yet she sought sanctuary in their church, for the goddess and her mercy is honored by all.
A blade in one hand as her other clutched her side, seeping in bright red blood.


## Vitamancer

The Vitamancer is someone, much like Poeh, who mastered the art of manipulating life magic.
Vitamancers are closely related to necromancers, yet they stand in sharp contrast in that their art is about manipulating the life force of living creatures, possibly putting that life force elsewhere, rather than capturing the lost souls of the dead or reanimating their corpses through unnatural means.

"acta deos numquam mortalia failunt", mortal actions never deceive the gods

### Powers

ad vitam aeternam, "to eternal life", "to life everlasting", a common Biblical phrase

## Bone Caller

A type of necromancer or vitamancer who specialized in bones and skeletons.
This is what Poeh is rumored to have become.
The first living skeleton.

"sero venientibus ossa", "Those who are late get bones"
"tarde venientibus ossa", "To the late are left hte bones"
