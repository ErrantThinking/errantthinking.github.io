## Prompt
 > The origin of undeath.

I've decided to provide some of the findings from my research I've done for this topic. Then follows a short story and a couple of "classes" and their abilities.

## History

I encountered a surprising statement that Bram Stoker's 1897 novel "Dracula" is responsible for establishing the term of the "undead" for our modern common concept.
However this seemed to be unverified without a proper citation on Wikipedia, so I decided to take a bit of look out of curiosity, although I was unable to provide a more definitive answer.
Another unverified statement and even more surprising claim is that Bram Stoker considered naming the famous novel "The Undead".
What is believable is that prior to "Dracula", the term "undead" meant "alive" or "not dead" instead of our common concept of "to be alive after death" especially with regards to the mortal coil's expiration.

Below is Google Books Ngram Viewer of works from 1500s-2022 for "undead","undeath", "un-dead", vampire, vampyre, and zombie.
For each keyword, this shows their percentage of ocurrence among other words.

From the 1980s onwards, the use of some of these terms dramatically increased, which makes it hard to see the variance of the prior years at this scale.
If we zoom in on the range 1500-1980, we can better observe the fluctuations.

Isolating just "undead", "undeath", and "un-dead" (how Bram Stoker would sometimes write it) within 1500-1980 we can better see their relative use.

From this we can see some use of "undeath", "undead", and even "un-dead" prior to Bram Stoker although he certainly initiates a peak at 1897.
These only show word use without providing the exact sources, so I'll leave this tangent here for now.


While the term for the concept is most firmly established in 1897, the idea of undeath greatly predates "Dracula".
This is to be expected with all the folklore across history including the concepts of the afterlife and accounts of resurrection or ghosts, revenants (Old French for "returning") and much more.
"Dracula" itself is inspired by the folktales that detail creatures similar to the vampire.

The **strigoi** of Romanian mythology and the **nosferatu**, an archaic Romanian word whose etymology is not fully understood.
Some of my favorite hypotheses being "nosferatu" is derived from "nesuferit" for "unbearable" or "insufferable", which is a great insult to drop on that big bad vampire in your next game.


## The Origin of Undeath

The tale of life is many. Of death, singular.
But of undeath? What of undeath?
The wretched undead, as I'm sure you've heard, are quite plentiful and various.
However, it all began from naught but one.
Let me tell you the tale of undeath's beginnings.

Once upon a time, where the sands of time have since drifted far beyond for a millennia, there once a small church.
In this church dwelled a priest, Poeh, who served his goddess faihfully and served as his town's local healer.
Poeh was a pacifist, a meek young man dedicated to his goddess and whose heart weeped for those in need.
He'd tend to the sick, the wounded, and the downtrodden regardless of any colors they flew.
Alas, this would be his doom.

One day full of the sun's bright rays burning down upon the sands and through the windows, a woman arrived, armor clad, and terribly wounded.
These sands knew well the taste of blood from countless wars and this one was simply another fresh drink.
She wore a tunic of blue hues of the invading army, yet she sought sanctuary in their church, for the goddess and her mercy is honored by all.
A blade in one hand as her other clutched her side, seeping in bright red blood.


## Vitamancer

The Vitamancer is someone, much like Poeh, who mastered the art of manipulating life magic.
Vitamancers are closely related to necromancers, yet they stand in sharp contrast in that their art is about manipulating the life force of living creatures, possibly putting that life force elsewhere, rather than capturing the lost souls of the dead or reanimating their corpses through unnatural means.

"acta deos numquam mortalia failunt", mortal actions never deceive the gods

### Powers

ad multos annos, "to many years",
ad vitam aeternam, "to eternal life", "to life everlasting", a common Biblical phrase
ad vitam aut culpam, "for life or until fault"
apologia pro vita sua, "defense of one's life",
aqua vitae, "water of life", spirit of wine referring to native distilled beverages
memento mori, "remember you must die"
amor fati, "love of fate",
ars longa, vita brevis, "art is long, life is short"

dum spiro spero, "while I breathe, I hope"

## Bone Caller

A type of necromancer or vitamancer who specialized in bones and skeletons.
This is what Poeh is rumored to have become.
The first living skeleton.

"sero venientibus ossa", "Those who are late get bones"
"tarde venientibus ossa", "To the late are left hte bones"
