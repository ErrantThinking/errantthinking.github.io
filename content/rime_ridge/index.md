As part of [Prismatic Wasteland's Rankin/Bass-themed 2025 Merry Hexmas](@/hexmas_2025/index.md), I present
the Rime Ridge, a dense mountain range thick with fog that tends to freeze into hard rime ice upon all surfaces.
An icey mountain range inspired by the Misty Mountains of the Hobbit.

## Random Encounters

### Roaming Characters in the Rime Ridge

- **Aeon the Terrible**
- Behemoth Bears
    - Big Bear lives with his wife, a normal sized Grizzly and their cub, notably they stay within a cottage.
- **The Wind Elementals**
    - Vagrant Wind
    - Raging Wing
    - Whispering Wind
- **Gorcs**: The hob goblin orcs of Rankin/Bass's animated films "Hobbit" and "The Return of the King".
    - Think brachycephalic cats and bull dog face meets stocky boar with sharp teeth and tusks.
        - oinks, barks, and purrs
    - They are similar to the thick and stocky moblins of "The Legend of Zelda".
    - **The Great Gorc** rules **Gorcington** hidden within the Rime Ridge
    - The Gorc-Bane Weapons: All burn in radiant fire in the presence of gorcs, and glow in the presence of orcs, goblins, and cats.
        - Gorcrend: A Zweihander. with parierhaken
        - Gorcrist: A hand and a half sword
        - Beater: A mace
- **Ramkins**: Are muscular beastmen with the torso and arms of a gorilla, the head of a ram with curling horns, and the hind legs and hooves of a ram. Their forearms are much more wooly and end with larger hands than a human and have three fingers that end similarly to deer toes. These muscular hands end with fingers and knuckles covered in a thick keratin that cover the joints but let them bend inwards. These hands are good for both running, climbing, grasping, and certainly punching.
    - A ramekin is always found among their belongings, even when travelling.
- **Tuskers**: Huge tusked trolls dwell in these mountains.
    - They thrive within the mists and caves of Rime Ridge where they avoid the sun which would turn them to stone
    - On the rare clear mornings, they remain in their holes and sleep in.
- **Catragon**: Rime Ridge has a feral catragon problem.
    - **Güneş** (Guenesh): A gargantuan female catragon.
- **Mountain Elementals**: They'll pelt rocks at each other and passerbys for a fun game of catch.

## Locations within the Rime Ridge

- **Aeon's** Nest
- **Blind Man's Bluff**
- **Gorcington**
- **Rimecrest**: A Dwarf fortress hidden in the mountains, now occupied by **Güneş** and her catragons.
    - Güneş dwells within purring atop a horde of silver and gold and other treasures.
    - Underneath the slumbering Güneş is the Heart of Fire, a large ruby red gemstone that is hot to the touch. A catragon would find this warmth quite inviting!
- The titular Rime Ridge : a mountain ridge that connects various mountains in the middle of this mountain range.
    - Walking atop the snow covered ridge lets you see above the rime and fog.
- Tusker Holes
