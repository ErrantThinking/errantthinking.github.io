I created a Rankin/Bass inspired creature that dwells in flocks among the mountain tops.
This creature is the **Ramkin**, an intelligent yet primitive being with a ram's head and curling horns as well as a ram's hind legs.
The ramkin's upperbody is like that of a gorilla, muscular and in this case wool covered.
Their hefty fists on their gorilla like arms are covered in keratin like their hooves, which protects their knuckles, and they have opposible thumbs with their two large and thick fingers which are plated in that keratin.
They can grip and climb with their hands as well as walk and run on them as if hooves.

They are often found among or near mountains or hills.

- **Ramkins**: Are muscular beastmen with the torso and arms of a gorilla, the head of a ram with curling horns, and the hind legs and hooves of a ram. Their forearms are much more wooly and end with larger hands than a human and have three fingers that end similarly to deer toes. These muscular hands end with fingers and knuckles covered in a thick keratin that cover the joints but let them bend inwards. These hands are good for both running, climbing, grasping, and certainly punching.
    - A ramekin is always found among their belongings, even when travelling.
