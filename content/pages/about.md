Hello there! I'm Errant and I'm thinking about a lot of things!
I often ponder technology, philosophy, story craft, and design.
My interests in design primarily include statistical experimental design, design of algorithmic solutions, and game design.
I am a researcher by occupation and here I share some of my thoughts.

**Asking insightful questions. Seeking thoughtful answers.**
