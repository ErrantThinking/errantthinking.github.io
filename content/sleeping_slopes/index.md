A jagged mountain range that features a long dormant volcano with a frozen tower at its top. The hollowed out volcano that was once mined for its riches and resources is now abandoned. Perhaps due to the dark secrets within its depths?

This is inspired by the Mines of Moria from "The Lord of the Rings".
