It was [Christmas in July](@/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md) and I'm finishing what I started.
I'm delivering a missing present to KingstanII from Secret Santicorn 2023.

## The Prompt

>d12 Cyborg Angels.

Flavorful! I immediately percieve the fusion of medieval fantasy knights and angels crossed with both the elegant & pristine science fiction and grimdark cyberpunk or science horror.

Also, I have now read up on angelology and the different hierarchy of angels, which I did not know about!
Looks like Thomas Aquinas was a busy lad, but not too busy to make a tier list of the angels.

## The Research & the Art

In doing this I learned more about the lore around angels in Christianity and adjacent religions and mythos.
