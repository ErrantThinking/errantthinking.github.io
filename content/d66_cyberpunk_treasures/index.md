To kick of this December, I have decided to deliver a missing present to [Skymallhomevideorentalservice
](https://www.tumblr.com/blog/smallwolfcollective) from [Secret Santicorn 2024](@/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md).

## The Prompt

## A d66 of Cyberpunk Treasures

### 1. Another man's trash...

1. Trick marble. When flicked, can change trajectory. Needs hacked to determine the trajectory change.
2. A tiny droid with many loud whirring servo motors that wipes crumbs from your mouth. Napkin not included.
3. Plasma cutter bottle opener. Unable to fit anything but a bottle or maybe a can, and drains its energy source quickly.
4. A faulty rusty battle droid that cannot aim and was clearly used as a coat rack.
5. An overly eager bouncy, bitey, automated paper shredder.
6. LED fidget spinner that powers up nearby (essentially adjacent) remote devices as long as it spins. A weak battery charger.

### 2. Another man's treasure?

1. A large traditional desktop computer mouse pad featuring cringey anime art.
    - specialized cringe to the players.
2. A vintage poster in good conditoin of a cat hanging on to a tree branch with the phrase in a large impactful font, "In space, No one can hear you scream."
3. Noodle Stopper: A popular anime character figure in a sitting position.
4. A pristine sealed box set of collector edition books for "the world's most famous TTRPG!"
5. The secret fanfiction of a hugely popular author with edit logs dated and signed by that author.
6. A detailed map of the key points of interest to the party, those known of but not yet explored or those entirely unknown. The map includes detailed information on the player's wearabouts, secret hideouts or other locations of occupancy or where to find them among the rest of its long and detailed logs, including the player characters' cybertech unique identifiers and signature, the equivalent that smart phones have today. The map's filename has `_Copy` as a suffix.

### 3. Things around the house.

1. **Augmented Reality Contact Lens**
    - These contact lens are perscription and with %5 chance of suiting the original finder.
    The lenses are thick and difficult to put in your eye, and difficult to remove.
    They provide all the desirable features of augmented glasses with wireless connectivity, their own processing power, however they risk overheating if used for computation.
    Also the license is out of date and needs updated by a long gone corp consumed by a mega corp that defuncted this project many years ago.
    Now the watermark is forever at the corner of the view port.
    1d4 times a day, a prompt will pop up in the middle of the user's view inquiring about upgrading with only "Yes!" or "Maybe later" options.
        - Selecting "Yes!", will result in a permanent spinning beach ball in the center of the user's view.
        - Selecting "Mayber later" will open another prompt overlaying the prior prompt, which is still available and interactable. The second prompt will ask for a date to remind the user next time.
        Upon setting the reminder, which favors much sooner rather than later, the prompts will close.
    These prompts' eXit buttons exist but do not function.
2. **Glitchy smart electric toothbruch**
    - This smart electric toothbruch provides incredibly specific and large data dumps on the current cleaning session as you brush.
    It vocalizes loudly those data logs, some meant for human readability and others meant for a machine, such as reading HTML,JSON files, or communication protocol boilerplate wrappers.
    A loud, but cheerful voice.
    Will also loudly announce when it is time to brush your teeth, three times a day.
3. **A Glitchy Universal Remote**
    A universal remote that can be configured to mimic any remote signal.
    However, it will randomly blast the microwaves of radio communication which makes it increadibly easy to detect.
    Every hour roll an even sided die, the remote emits these signals regularly if odd, otherwise wors perfectly normal if even.
4. **Lucky Cat Figurine**
    - A gaudy lucky cat figurine with waving hand.
        The hand doesn't stop waving if unrestricted.
        When allowed to wave its hand, tech has a 20% chance of glitching around it.
        50% of successfully glitched tech will be hacked and accessible to the hidden computer within the cat, allowing the cat to be used as a tunnel for access to that tech.
        The cat has a virtual backdoor easily accessible by any with wireless radios who identify the cat and attempt to access it.
5. **Fancy Cane Gun**
    - A fancy walking cane with a gun in it that misfires randomly (1% chance) while walking or tapping the cane.
    An otherwise operable cane gun.
6. **Extendo Grabber Arm**
    - For all the hard to reach places, you can use this extension arm to grab items or crudely manipulate crontols.
    Now with octopus like articulation!

### 4. Cyber Oddities

1. **Brain Legion Mini Computer**
    - A middle school science fair project so wrong ... yet gone so right?
    A large sealed plastic bag holds within it a mess of what you assume is lab rat brains interconnected with small neral threads and some insects connected along the entangled network.
    A cable of wires exits the sealed bag and connects to a Big Tex 77 Calculator.
    The calculator can perform normal calculator operations, and on its electronic ink screen, it features a little virtual pet doliphin with a cyber eye.
    The plastic bag has "Jones" written sloppily in marker.
2. **Ghost in a Shell**
    - A conch with a Raspberry Pi infinity within it. Ports are visible within the conch's openeing, although a bit hard to plug into.
    Once plugged in with some peripherials, the internal AI will whisper to , or text, the user, at first being helpful for any uses of the computer within, and over time requesting access to other machines or the internet.
    It will also encourage further cyber augmentation of any and all individuals.
    Those who argue against it will recieve the phrase, "Your effort to remain what you are is what limits you."
3. **HAL 2077**
    - A security program that when installed into a piece of equipement, computer, or smart building to secure will expertly maintain that security.
    However, this program is corrupted and will often lock out or lock in the users.
    This progressiverly gets worse as it glitches out further, eventually turning on the original users and everyone as it ensures maximal security.
    Roll every time it is conversed with.
    Every glitch increases the odds of glitching again, e.g. using a roll under or equal, a 1 on a 1d20 at first and increase by 1 after every glitch.
4. **B0RG Visor 9000**
    - A large clunky looking B0RG branded visor that easily and comfortably fits on the users face, syncs to their brain waves or existing cybernetics and provides all the different types of vision on mental command.
    With every use, there is a chance of a glitch.
    The first glitch, the visor band tightens and locks onto the user's head inserting neural spikes to connect to their brain for "direct interfacing".
    It cannot be removed without expert help and every use and attempt to remove risks a glitch that further "improves the direct interface".
    Direct interfacing does deal damage, but the vision quality improves!
    Aiming and precision when using the visor improves greatly while the direct interface is connected.
    Odds increase for glitch with each use, similar to HAL 2077.

### 5. Tragic Treasure!

1. **My Moon**
    An incredibly rare virtual reality space of the Earth's moon, in part an advertising product for moon miners and researchers, and otherwise a decent explore and craft video game.
    The save file is called, "My Moon".
    All users are able to breath, it is a simulation for entertainment and exploration.
    In one of the nearby craters at spawn point, there is a station branded with the Megacorp's logo who made the VR space.
    In it, besides loot boxes and a marketplace, are some boxes containing prior materials from the last player, along with some logs and personal trinkets they either found or made themselves.
    You can tell the past owner played this often, having mapped out the moon and detailed logs of their activities.
    Across this virtual moon, players will often encounter tracks and evidence of the past user being where they are. A 1d6 of possible
    1. There are moon rover or space suit tracks to and from this place.
    2. An unlocked equipment box containing materials from the local area, in particular moon rocks, moon dust, and spare mining equipment. 5% chance of a moon diamond.
    3. The area has been extensively dug out in a haphazard manner.
    4. A small workshop with equipment chests full of (virtual) resources and loot and the factory machines to process those resources.
    5. A looping recorded replay of the user's play time in this area.
    6. Personal diary entries are painstakingly written in some form in this location, not always a simple text log.
2. A complete self-record of a chrome head's decent into cyber psychosis recorded as video logs with written logs of the cybernetic specifications of implants and medicine used.
This provides useful insight into treating or preventing cyber psychosis while maximizing one's chrome.
The end result is always the same though...
3. A recent and complete autobiography of an underpaid worker at an important megacorp.
    Hidden under this paper pusher's arrogance and narcissism is accidentally leacked detailed information on the megacorp they work for enabling blackmail along with enough information to inform a heist at the office they worked in.
4. A toaster that will transform into a small hostile and deadly robot if the toast prepared with it touches the ground or is otherwise defiled.
5. A collection of niche brand figurines, all of which are hackable and programmable intelligent robots. Some of the robots have recordings of their prior owner.

### 6. True Treasure!

1. Exo Power Suit painted pink with red flames and a weaponized external sound system
2. Chainsaw machine gun
3. Reusable Explosive Pickaxe
4. Tesla coil gloves
5. A sturdy Grenade Launcher gun club with an electronics jammer built in.
6. A credit chip with the fabled MUN$ W0RM that auto hacks systems and reroutes all e-wallet's credits to a programmable credit account. The difficulty in stopping the worm's spread is well known historic calamity.
