Settlemeents often serve as a safe haven or a base of operations in traditional roleplaying games, with cities being the most common case for an adventure site in itself.
What about other settlements?
As part of the New School Revolution RPG Cauldron Secret Santicorn I'm hosting in 2025, which is separate from the typical Rainbow OSR Secret Santicorn, I have recieved a request by [Sully Tames](https://sultansmusings.bearblog.dev/) to explore making the settlement itself the adventure site.


## Prompt
 > The town/settlement as an adventure site in itself. What if you never had to leave the tavern to go on an adventure?

 I shall cover the part of the history of settlement based adventures in TTRPGs, identify their trends and properties, and provide guidelines on how to make a satisfying adventure in a settlement.

## History & Relevant Works

It is worth exploring some history and prior works that have prvoided such adventures within the settlements themselves as I think they will provide nice examples and inspiration while also providing some insight into how to do this in a general way.
Most common are large scale settlements as cities and in general can even be treated as dungeons themselves.
Call of Cthulhu and the like also tend to provide some adventures for specific settlements or even single buildings, such as manors.

### Cities

These tend to be essentially Megacities, which are expansive or even procedurally generated like Megadungeons.

### Towns & Villages

### Isolated Buildings

Cottages, Mansions, Farms, Forts, and Inns are among the smallest settlements you can get with some spark of society, while still being separated from it all.
The civilization or really civility in these locations are small slivers of the society in which they exemplify.
The culture and customs are still present, albeit different based on the local changes that occured in isolation.

- Roadside Inns

## Properties of Settlement Adventures

## Some Patterns

### The Settlement as a Dungeon

Turn the typical formula of settlements as safe havens and dungeons as dangerous on its head.
Make the settlement be a dungeon!
