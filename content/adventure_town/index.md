Settlemeents often serve as a safe haven or a base of operations in traditional roleplaying games, with cities being the most common case for an adventure site in itself.
What about other settlements?
As part of the New School Revolution RPG Cauldron Secret Santicorn I'm hosting in 2025, which is separate from the typical Rainbow OSR Secret Santicorn, I have recieved a request by [Sully Tames](https://sultansmusings.bearblog.dev/) to explore making the settlement itself the adventure site.


## Prompt
> The town/settlement as an adventure site in itself. What if you never had to leave the tavern to go on an adventure?

 I shall cover in brief part of the history of settlement based adventures in TTRPGs, identify some of their trends and properties, and provide my thoughts on how to make a satisfying adventure in a settlement.

## History & Relevant Works

It is worth exploring some history and prior works that have prvoided such adventures within the settlements themselves as I think they will provide nice examples and inspiration while also providing some insight into how to do this in a general way.
Most common are large scale settlements as cities and in general can even be treated as dungeons themselves.
Call of Cthulhu and the like also tend to provide some adventures for specific settlements or even single buildings, such as manors.

### Cities

These tend to be essentially Megacities, which are expansive or even procedurally generated like Megadungeons.

### Isolated Buildings

Cottages, mansions, farms, forts, and [roadside inns](http://127.0.0.1:1111/roadside-inns/) are among the smallest settlements you can get with some spark of society, while still being separated from it all.
The civilization or really civility in these locations are small slivers of the society that they exemplify.
The culture and customs are still present, albeit different based on the local changes that occur in isolation.

    - Call of Cthulhu features many mysteries that take place entirely in one building or a single town. Some include:
        - [Arkham](https://lovecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Arkham_(Call_of_Cthulhu)) setting is a town.
        - [Mansions of Madness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansions_of_Madness_(Call_of_Cthulhu))
            - Looks like 4/5 stay in one mansion or town.

### Settlement (Setting) Building

These games either constrain their focus to a village or town or could be played with such a constraint.

[Microscope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microscope_(role-playing_game)) is a roleplaying game where players create a fictional timeline and role-play pspecific events in that timeline.
This could be used to tell the story of a village, town, or otherwise.
This being a game itself could be the game and "adventure" told through Microscope alone.
Otherwise, this could establish the town as a setting to be played through.

    - Survival from famine, natural disasters, uprisings, martial law, or industrial accidents

    - Key locations with placement.
    - NPCs & Factions with their own behaviors & goals. Place in map.
    - Events & encounters and emphasize escalation and link to NPCs, factions, and locations.
    - Resource pressure, good for survival games and building tension.

## Properties of Settlement Adventures

## Some Patterns

### The Settlement as a Dungeon

Turn the typical formula of settlements as safe havens and dungeons as dangerous on its head.
Make the settlement be a dungeon!

- Mausritter: Houses or other buildings become akin to dungeons.
- An inverted bastionland: Where instead of the bastion being where you are safe, it is where you are in danager.
    - A city overrun with undead monsters that holds many secrets and the means to librerate the city to recover the bastion. The outside is restricted by limited resources and weather or other such conditions that force people to leave due to resource scarcity or threat to health. You get a week there for rest, but then must return to the city.

### Mystery

Whodunit, murder mystery,

### Social Drama

#### Romance

#### Political Intrigue

#### Occupational: Commerce

### Slice of Life

### Settlement Building

While this may be it own minigame in other games, and typically not an adventure in itself, these do share properties with such dedicated settlement building games that include a story to be told.

- His Majesty the Worm city building
- Mausritter settlement building

## Conclusion

This was a good request and it turned out to relate to some of my prior interests that I've explored a bit before.
I did not include much if any of my prior work from those here and I will definitely write a survey and my thoughts on those in the future.
Those topics include game design for adventures in general, social drama and dynamics, mystery, political intrigue, and romance.

This was a part of the [RPG Cauldron Secret Santicorn](https://discourse.rpgcauldron.com/t/rpg-cauldron-secret-santicorn-2025/3365) event.
