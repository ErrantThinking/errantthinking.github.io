A Rankin/Bass themed location for a [Merry Hexmas](@/hexmas_2025/index.md) based on their 1982 animation of "The Last Unicorn".
Where the mountains meet the coastline Haggard's Stronghold stubbornly resits the crashing waves of the Swirly Twirly Sea of Gumdrops.

The last candy cane caribou is somewhere in the North Pole, and is on a journey to find if she really is the last of her kind.
This hex is her final destination where all her questions will finally be answered.

<!-- more -->

Roll a 2d8, re-rolling any that is an 8.
These two numbers inform which hex the last candy cane caribou is currently in.
Using this hex as an example, the hex number for Haggard's Stronghold is 707.
If you rolled two 7's, then the candy cane caribou would be in this hex.
The last candy cane caribou would already be at her destination!

## Rumors of Haggard's Stronghold

King Haggard has holed up in his stronghold, letting his kingdom rot as he wastes away.

His royal wizard has been known to sow mayhem with his magic's.
There are various creatures or encounters for which his magic is the cause.

#### The Haggard Red Bull

After the red bull is felled, King Haggard's soul will possess the red bull to create The Haggard Red Bull, a red monstrous minotaur fuming with Haggard's obsession.

### Haggard's Stronghold

A large stronghold sits atop a cliff facing the Swirly Twirly Sea of Gumdrops.

There is a secret passage from within the stronghold to location of the captured candy cane caribou.
Haggard knows it, but won't tell.
There is a skeleton who is an oenophile within the halls of the stronghold.
He seems to know the way, or at least mocks the adventurers with his supposed possession of this knowledge.

#### King Haggard

King Haggard is infatuated with the candy cane caribou and has worked to capture all of them he could within the confines of the candy coast below his castle perched cliff.

### The Wily Wizard's Warped & Writhing Wicked Willow

Nearby to the stronghold on another cliff on the coast is a huge overgrown willow tree.
It is said that this willow tree was infused with a great deal of magic by the wizard who served King Haggard.
If a creature disturbs this tree, its roots will shoot out and attempt to grapple the creature.
The willow will then writhe and whomp the ground which will destroy the cliff where it and the creatures sit leaving them to fall into the cold crashing waters below.
The willow, now released from its earthly prison, will wreak havoc upon the creatures that fell with it and the shoreline.

The willow tree swells in size from the water and is now a gargantuan threat that is speedy to boot with its many roots and limbs serving as multiple appendages.
Further with all the water, it is resistant to fire.

The tree needs removed or led away from the water in order to shrink back to its original size and to become weak to fire again.

The willow possesses the ability to release a scream like that of a mandrake.

### The Candy Coast

The sands are the crushed shards of hard candy.
Washed up swirly twirly gumdrops line the shore.
This shore is beneath the steep cliff face where Haggard's Stronhold is perched and the Willow's Cliff.

The candy cane caribou are trapped within these tumultuous waters, unable to escape from fear of the red bull.

The red bull rests within a cave on this coast under Haggard's Stronghold.
