It's [Christmas in July](@/christmas_in_july_2025/index.md) and I'm delivering a missing present to [Kontent Punch](https://www.kontentpunch.com/) from Secret Santicorn 2024.

## The Prompt

> Oh no, it's Snow!

At first, I interpreted this as make some snow problems to solve, monsters in particular as this is OSR.
I later realized that it is "Snow" not "snow" so its a named entity.
So here's a **1d4** of cold based elementals and if I come back to this, I'll add some loose concept for a named entity of Snow, perhaps a character or a supernatural spirit.

:warning: This one is a stub. I'll come back and provide some stats.

## Cold-based Elementals

This is in part inspired by the concept I had for living snow men as in Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer the stop motion animated feature.
I used that concept along with solid glacier elementals as fae creatures in my [The Elves Revolt!](@/the-elves-revolt.md) 2024 Santicorn write-up.
Here I extend upon them further and give them some stat blocks in different OSR or adjacent games.
Each cold elemental is based around some state of matter or a mixture, such as solid, liquid, or gas.

These elementals are similar to fae in that they are empathetic to other living creatures around them and mirror their feelings.
When there is suffering in the world, they are known to lash out and be depressed.

### 1. Ice Elemental (Solid)

A large, lumbering ice elemental.
Commonly found among glaciers, whether on them, in them, or floating with them.
Also found in caves and wherever there is copious amounts of large chunks of ice.

### 2. Snow Elemental (Air + Solid)

The solid yet disintegrated version of the ice elemental.
When at peace, these are your living snowmen.
When excited, they become a flurry and whirlwind of snow!

### 3. Freezing Water Elemental (Liquid + Solid)

This elemental is essentially the same as your typical water elemental, however it can freeze and unfreeze parts of its body at will.
This can entrap enemies or be used to craft tools needed for the job at hand for the elemental.
If one is entrapped in its frigid waters, then it can turn small parts into little ice blades and it circulates those through its body to harm the ensnared victim.

### 4. Frost Elemental (Air)

These elementals are one with the frigid air and their contact can cause things to freeze over and get frosty.
They are similar to air elementals in that they are essentially incorporeal as always in their gaseous form.

You wonder if this is what people mean by "Jack Frost nipping at your nose".
