As with everyone, let alone bloggers, life can grab you by the collar and you just gotta run with it!
With my hectic life aside, I feel it is appropriate to set some expectations for what kind of content I intend to write here, along with a brief introduction.
Even if it is mostly to motivate myself to check off some boxes in the future, heheh.

I am Errant and I think about _many_ things!
In my daily life, I am a computer scientist to the fullest extent.
I research topics, analyze problems, design mathematical models & develop algorithmic solutions!
Here, I will do the same for my hobbies, sharing more freeform thoughts that occur over time as I learn, and revising some pages as a wiki for the refined concepts.

## Community Creative Events

So far, my blog's content has mostly been for community blogging events, especcially the OSR Secret Santicorn.
My first post was a TTRPG adventure I made in three days for last year's Santicorn, and since then I've compiled a history of that event and wrote some more for past blog prompts.
<!--I have some posts I deem "stubs" or seedlings and that I intend to refine over time.
-->
I also have more unpublished responses worth sharing after a polish (I'm looking at you, 1d12 of Cyborg Angels).
I will continue these and other community blog events, but I do not intend it to be my main form of content.

## Asking Questions, Sharing Thoughts

In the beginning and to this day, I _intend_ Errant Thinking to be primarily about **educational** content for my various muses:

- science,
- technology,
- philosophy,
- psychology,
- writing.

I'm inspired by various content creators in education including but certainly not limited to:

- Overly Sarcastic Productions : Writing & History
- [3 Blue 1 Brown](https://www.3blue1brown.com/) : Mathematics
- [Veritasium](https://www.veritasium.com/) : Science & Engineering
- [Minute Physics](https://www.minutephysics.com/) : Physics

The engineering projects on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/) also look incredibly fun and  [distill.pub](https://distill.pub/) (now on indefinite hiatus) featured superb interactive tutorials, which fortunately continue to pop up over the internet.
Exploring fun projects and making educational tutorials and articles are my primary intended content.

###  Why Tabletop Rolplaying Games (TTRPGs)?

A natural question to ask.
TTRPGs have been a love of mine since I was young and I recently delved deeper into them as I have found they let me explore a plethora of my hobbies all together!

- I practice my 2D art, whether traditional sketches or digital painting.
- I hone my narrative ability in storytelling, improvisation, and adventure craft.
- I design & develop games faster than video game development, which is another of my hobbies, but one that has a steeper learning curve for the tools (I've been learning [Godot](https://godotengine.org/)).
- Mathematical modeling of probabilities and game theory certainly applies along with good UX design.
- I also get to explore civilization structure, operations, and politics.

Truly a great creative outlet.
Perhaps best of all, I get to have fun with my friends and the lovely community of TTRPG designers!

## Order of Operations

Here's a smattering of my current priorities for hobby content I'll post here:

1. TTRPGs
    - My own games and their related topics:
        - **Small Souls**: Everything it touches upon will get a post:
            - Collection of Media, TTRPGs, and blogs on little people & creatures
            - playable character design
                - The probability of dice pools (A big blog post here!)
                - The experience gameplay procedures
                - character state and user experience (UX)
                - experiential character growth
            - creature design
            - world building, especially biomes
            - faction design & dynamics in play
            - adventure design
            - Box Set design: I am excited about this one! Brings it all together.
            - promotion, marketing, getting it to those who want it.
        - **The Gnomies**: A whimsical game about things spiralling out of control, primarily for one shots and ridiculous hijinks.
        - **Affinity Divined** : A Tarot card based retroactive story telling game inspired by For the Queen and Decuma for world building and backstories.
        - Loose Ideas: Mecha Game, Cyberpunk game.
    - My own settings / adventures:
        - **The Hunt of Jolnir** : An epic christmas folklore adventure.
        - **Ophelos**: A medieval fantasy island setting inspired by Helenistic and maybe Mediterranian folklore.
            - "The Verdant Voyager" : a seafaring adventure on the way to Ophelos.
    - A TTRPG blogosphere quickstart guide, esp. for a TTRPG game designer.
2. Meta :
    - update website theme/style to something custom and clean
    - add useful functionality to website,
        - meta tag feed under About, so it serves as a "now" page too.
        - Comments on site somehow, as indpendent yet cross platform as possible
        - Newsletter eventually.
    - properly setup tag system for Atom/RSS
        - Feeds already exist but may change unless I can keep em as is.
        - I have programmer and design thoughts on tags and how they are terrific. Worth a blog post, perhaps more about "blogging" or "technology" than meta.
3. Writing and Philosophy
    - On writing, I have considerations on the information contained within --or, more interestingly,  _not_ contained within--  a __poem__, or the various meanings of __idioms__.
    - I have long had thoughts about self-reflection, especially around this time of year of late November--New Years.
4. Science & Technology :
    - No idea atm. I know I can talk about probability & statistics and modeling problems.  That will probably occur throughout my other interests.
    - I was considering some Hydroponics experiments late last summer, but I messed up growing the seedlings. RIP.
5. Other:  I also want to include some recipes, which I've alredy [snuck a couple in a prior post](@/roadside_inns/index.md).

Science and technology could get jostled up in priorty on a whim.
Although, this is my current intent, and hopefully the act of listing it out will  give me some form of accountability to eventually deliver that which I either am or wish to be creating.

## Join in on the Fun!
